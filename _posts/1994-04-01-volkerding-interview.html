&mdash; In the first issue of Linux Journal we interviewed Linux
Torvarlds. In this issue we interview Patrick Vokerding, the author of
&#8220;Slackware&#8221;, one of the most popular Linux distributions.

<p>
<b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b> First I would like to find out a little
about you. How old are you?

<p>
<b>Pat:</b> I'm 27.

<p>
<b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b> What you do for work, school, etc?

<p>
<b>Pat:</b> For school, well.... I finally got my BS in computer
science from Moorhead State University last Spring. On the 8 year
plan, actually. I started out in computer engineering at Boston
University in `85, did that for 2 years, and then took a year off
before transferring into the CS program at MSU.

<p>
I just recently got a job for a San Francisco-based company making
medical archiving systems controlled by Linux boxes. It's been pretty
interesting work.

<p>
<b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b> I am looking for articles on the
commercial use of Linux. I would be real interested in an article on
what you are doing there.

<p>
What you do for fun?

<p>
<b>Pat:</b> I do all kinds of things for fun. Linux is my big fun
project right now - gets pretty crazy sometimes trying to keep up with
all of the development going on; for instance, last week the new C
libraries, GCC, and kernel were all released within a couple days of
each other. Luckily, I like keeping my machine current. Judging from
the mail I get when things fall a bit behind, so does everyone else.

<p>
Hmmmmm.... other things? Well, I like to brew my own beer.  That was
my big hobby until Linux began to demand more of my time.  It's a fun
process. My favorite part is firing up my 140K BTU burner and boiling
it up for an hour or so. The aroma it releases when you throw the hops
into the rolling boil is magnificent! The Homebrew Digest and
rec.crafts.brewing were my big Internet hangouts before I came across
Linux.

<p>
I also love music, especially the Grateful Dead. I've gone to,
oh... 75 or so of their shows. The summers of `87 and `88 I followed
the band all over the US in my `67 Firebird convertible.  I've also
got lots of portable recording equipment and tape the shows whenever I
can. The Dead let their fans do this, which is pretty unique in the
music world.

<p>
I play guitar, too. I'm still waiting for Jerry [Garcia] to invite me
up on stage. :^)

<p>
<b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b> Another DeadHead? I've only gone to 30 or
40 shows. My first show was in 1974 and I have around 100 tapes from
shows.

<p>
Now, on to the real stuff.

<p>
When did you first start working with computers?

<p>
<b>Pat:</b> Way back in 1973 when I was just a kid, I went on a field
trip with my class to the computer department at North Dakota State
University. The room where they kept the machines totally amazed me -
lots of big whirring machines with flashing lights all over the place
and rows of those big drives with disk platters. One of the sysops
showed me how to play Star Trek on a DecWriter teletype-style
terminal. It was an instantaneous addiction.

<p>
At the time, though, there was no way I could get a home computer. I
don't even think such things existed, so I started getting interested
in electronics, which was more accessible. I'd build logic gates out
of relays and things like that. When the first personal computers like
the TRS-80, Apple ][, and Atari 400/800 came out, I became a fixture
in many of the stores that sold them. I couldn't afford one, but the
store owners would let me hang out and use their machines. I taught
myself BASIC and would write little store demo programs to ensure I'd
stay welcome there.

<p>
I got an Apple ][ Plus with a 300 baud AppleCat modem right around
1980, when it was the hot machine. I used Apple as my only computer
right up until 1990. I even had a C compiler and Unix-like operating
system for it. It was nothing even resembling Linux, though.

<p>
<b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b> When did you first start working with
Linux? Pat: I first heard about Linux in late 1992 from a friend named
Wes at a party in Fargo, North Dakota. I didn't download it right
away, but when I needed to find a LISP interpreter for a project at
school, I remembered seeing people mention clisp ran on Linux. So, I
ended up downloading one of the versions of Peter MacDonald's SLS
distribution. <i>Linux Journal</i>: Describe what Slackware is?

<p>
<b>Pat:</b> Well, I guess I can assume we all know what Linux is. :^)
Slackware consists of a basic Linux system (the kernel, shared
libraries, and basic utilities), and a number of optional software
packages such as the GNU C and C++ compilers, networking and mail
handling software, and the X window system.

<p>
<b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b> Why did you decide to do a distribution?

<p>
<b>Pat:</b> That's a good one. I never really did decide to do a
distribution. What happened was that my AI professor wanted me to show
him how to install Linux so that he could use it on his machine at
home, and share it with some graduate students who were also doing a
lot of work in LISP. So, we went into the PC lab and installed the SLS
version of Linux.

<p>
Having dealt with Linux for a few weeks, I'd put together a pile of
notes describing all the little things that needed to be fixed after
the main installation was complete. After spending nearly as much time
going through the list and reconfiguring whatever needed it as we had
putting the software on the machine in the first place, my professor
looked at me and said, &#8220;Is there some way we can fix the install disks
so that new machines will have these fixes right away?&#8221;. That was the
start of the project. I changed parts of the original SLS installation
scripts, fixing some bugs and adding a feature that installed
important packages like the shared libraries and the kernel image
automatically.

<p>
I also edited the description files on the installation disks to make
them more informative. Most importantly, I went through the software
packages, fixing any problems I found. Most of the packages worked
perfectly well, but some needed help. The mail, networking, and uucp
software had a number of incorrect file permissions that prevented it
from functioning out of the box. Some applications would coredump
without any explanation&mdash;for those I'd go out looking for source
code on the net. SLS only came with source code for a small amount of
the distribution, but often there would be new versions out anyway, so
I'd grab the source for those and port them over. When I started on
the task, I think the Linux kernel was at around 0.98pl4 (someone else
may remember that better than I do...), and I put together improved
SLS releases for my professor through version 0.99pl9. By this time
I'd gotten ahead of SLS on maybe half of the packages in the
distribution, and had done some reconfiguration on most of the
remaining half. I'd done some coding myself to fix long-standing
problems like a finger bug that would say users had `Never logged in'
whenever they weren't online.  The difference between SLS and
Slackware was starting to be more than just cosmetic.

<p>
In May, or maybe as late as June of `93, I'd brought my own
distribution up to the 4.4.1 C libraries and Linux kernel
0.99pl11A. This brought significant improvements to the networking and
really seemed to stabilize the system. My friends at MSU thought it
was great and urged me to put it up for FTP. I thought for sure SLS
would be putting out a new version that included these things soon
enough, so I held off for a few weeks. During this time I saw a lot of
people asking on the net when there would be a release that included
some of these new things, so I made a post entitled &#8220;Anyone want an
SLS-like 0.99pl11A system?&#8221; I got a tremendous response to the post.

<p>
After talking with the local sysadmin at MSU, I got permission to open
an anonymous FTP server on one of the machines - an old 3b2. I made an
announcement and watched with horror as multitudes of FTP connections
crashed the 3b2 over, and over, and over. Those who did get copies of
the 1.00 Slackware release did say some nice things about it on the
net. My archive space problems didn't last long, either. Some people
associated with Walnut Creek CDROM (and ironically enough, members of
the 386BSD core group) offered me the current archive space on
ftp.cdrom.com.

<p>
<b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b> Why did you call it Slackware?

<p>
<b>Pat:</b> My friend J.R. &#8220;Bob&#8221; Dobbs suggested it. ;^) Although I've
seen people say that it carries negative connotations, I've grown to
like the name. It's what I started calling it back when it was really
just a hacked version of SLS and I had no intention of putting it up
for public retrieval. When I finally did put it up for FTP, I kept the
name. I think I named it &#8220;Slackware&#8221; because I didn't want people to
take it all that seriously at first.

<p>
It's a big responsibility setting up software for possibly thousands
of people to use (and find bugs in). Besides, I think it sounds better
than &#8220;Microsoft&#8221;, don't you?

<p>
<b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b> Some of the people out here in Seattle
call them MicroSquish. :-) I admit that I initially avoided going from
SLS to Slackware because I didn't take the name seriously. But the
feedback I heard on the Internet pointed out why I should take it
seriously. What did you expect to happen with the distribution?

<p>
<b>Pat:</b> I never planned for it to last as long as it has. I
thought Peter MacDonald (of SLS) would take a look at what I was doing
and would fix the problems with SLS. Instead, he claimed distribution
rights on the Slackware install scripts since they were derived from
ones included in SLS.  I was allowed to keep what I had up for FTP,
but told Peter I wouldn't make other changes to Slackware until I'd
written new installation scripts to replace the ones that came from
SLS. I wrote the new scripts, and after putting that much work into
things I wasn't going to give up. I did everything I could to make
Slackware the distribution of choice, integrating new software and
upgrades into the release as fast as they came out. It's a lot of
work, and sometimes I wonder how long I can go on for.

<p>
<b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b> What sort of help have you received?

<p>
<b>Pat:</b> Most recently, Savio Lam wrote the dialog program used to
create the color installation menus on the latest release of Slackware
(1.1.2). Ian Kluft put the smail package together for me. Vince
Shakan's newspak collection of configuration scripts were very useful
for compiling applications like elm and Taylor UUCP. Louis LaBash just
contributed a kit to compile a version of perl with working IPC. Early
on, Allen Gwinn sent me the lpd package. All the users that send me
bug reports helped a lot, too. I especially like when they don't flame
me too severely in the process.

<p>
Other than a few key packages from development teams that I trust,
like GNU GCC from H.J. Lu, or the XFree86 2.0 package, I compile
nearly all of the software myself. There are still a few remaining
bits of SLS in the package - you can spot them by looking for files
with 1992 time stamps.

<p>
<b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b> Do you have any idea of the number of
copies of Slackware that might be in use today?

<p>
<b>Pat:</b> Thousands, but it would be hard to estimate an exact
count. I have no idea how many CDs have been pressed with Slackware on
them, but I can think of four companies that have produced
them. Harald T. Alvestrand, who is attempting to count Linux users,
posted this estimate: I don't claim that these numbers are in any way
unbiased. They are just the 240 machine descriptions that have arrived
at the counter.  Obviously, they give a slight bias towards
net-oriented releases.

<p>
Of the seven &#8220;unknown&#8221; ones, two were misspellings of slackware. There
are biases in the summing too; one who listed &#8220;slackware, sls&#8221; got
only the &#8220;slackware&#8221; part counted. At least, it is a datum.

<p>
(Now for some wild speculation: If this is average, and 8000 LGX CDs
have been sold, and 9 of them turn up here, that would mean that I
have a return rate of 0.11 percent on LGX users. A similar return rate
on the others would mean 218,000 machines in the Linux installed
base. My statistics professor would flunk me for extrapolation.....)

<p>
<b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b> Does Slackware have a future?

<p>
<b>Pat:</b> I would like to think so. I really enjoy working with
Linux, and have had a blast making a complete package like Slackware
available and easy enough for beginners to install. Ian Murdock (of
the Debian distribution) and I have tossed around the idea of a merger
since last fall. It's possible that this could eventually happen.

<p>
At this point, I've got some nice scripts that create packages,
including the installation scripts that create the symbolic
links. Other than answering my mail, it's not that hard to keep
Slackware up to date. If I'm going to bother to keep my own machine
current, I might as well be updating the packages on the FTP site at
the same time.

<p>
<b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b> Do you want/expect any commercial benefit
from Slackware?

<p>
<b>Pat:</b> I haven't accepted any so far. It would be nice to make
money as a result of it, but not from selling the actual package. I'm
not interested in going into the mail-order CD-ROM business or
anything like that, but my experience with Linux has taught me a lot
of valuable skills. It looks like the project has saved me from a life
of COBOL. What more could I ask for than that?

<p>
<b><i>Linux Journal</i>:</b> Thanks for doing this. I think the
readers are going to be real interested in this monthly interview
column and I really want to get people from all walks of the Linux
world interviewed.

<p>
<b>Pat:</b> Sure!
