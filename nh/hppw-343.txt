HP and power starting values, level increases, and regeneration in NetHack 3.4
Compiled by Dylan O'Donnell <psmith@spod-central.org>.

Initial hit points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Characters start with a fixed number of hit points according to
their role:

Arc  Bar  Cav  Hea  Kni  Mon  Pri  Ran  Rog  Sam  Tou  Val  Wiz
 11   14   14   11   14   12   12   13   10   13    8   14   10

modified by racial bonuses:

Dwa  Elf  Gno  Hum  Orc
 +4   +1   +1   +2   +1


Hit point gain per level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This varies according to whether your character is "high level" or not;
more experienced characters generally gain HP more slowly. High level
characters are those that have reached the following experience levels:

Arc  Bar  Cav  Hea  Kni  Mon  Pri  Ran  Rog  Sam  Tou  Val  Wiz
 14   10   10   20   10   10   10   12   11   11   14   10   12

The base HP (and max HP) increment when gaining an experience level is:

      Arc  Bar  Cav  Hea  Kni  Mon  Pri  Ran  Rog  Sam  Tou  Val  Wiz
low:  +d8 +d10  +d8  +d8  +d8  +d8  +d8  +d6  +d8  +d8  +d8  +d8  +d8
high:  +1   +2   +2   +1   +2   +1   +1   +1   +1   +1   +0   +2   +1

with racial modifiers:

      Dwa  Elf  Gno  Hum  Orc
low:  +d3   +1   +1  +d2   +1
high:  +2   +1   +0   +1   +0

and a bonus or penalty for constitution:

    3 : -2
  4-6 : -1
 7-14 : +0
15-16 : +1
   17 : +2
   18 : +3
   19+: +4

You will always gain at least one HP when gaining a level.


Hit point regeneration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If your hit points are reduced below their maximum level, they will
usually regenerate over time. HP do not regenerate during the period of
invulnerability while praying to a receptive god.

If you are polymorphed into another monster, you will regain 1 HP every
20 turns provided you are no worse than Burdened (every turn, ignoring
encumbrance, if you have the regeneration intrinsic); the exception is
if you are a sea monster out of water, when you will lose 1 HP each turn
(but never to zero).

If you are in your normal form, the frequency and amount of HP you
regenerate depends on your experience level and constitution. Unless you
have regeneration, you will not regain HP if you are moving or fighting
while Stressed or worse (indeed, doing so while Strained will cause you
to lose 1 HP every 30 turns, every 10 turns while Overtaxed, until you
don't have enough stamina to move or you pass out).

If your experience level (XL) is 10 or less:

  regain 1 HP every number of turns depending on the following table:
       XL:   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
    TURNS:  15  11   9   8   7   6   5   5   4   3

If your experience level (XL) is 11 or greater:

  every 3 turns, regain HP depending on CON. 
  CON = 3-12 : 1 HP.
  CON = 13+ : d(CON), but no more than XL-9.

If you have regeneration:

  gain 1 HP on any turn which you would not otherwise.



Initial power
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Characters start the game with an amount of magical power dependent
on their role:

Arc  Bar  Cav  Hea  Kni  Mon  Pri  Ran  Rog  Sam  Tou  Val  Wiz
 1    1    1   1+d4 1+d4 2+d2 4+d3  1    1    1    1    1   4+d3

modified by racial bonuses:

Dwa Elf Gno Hum Orc
 +0  +2  +2  +1  +1


Power gain per level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For some roles only, this varies according to whether your character is
"high level" or not; more experienced characters may gain power slightly
more quickly. High level characters are those that have reached the
following experience levels:

Hea  Kni  Mon  Pri  Wiz
 20   10   10   10   12

The amount of power gained is determined by rolling a die with
((WIS / 2) + X) sides. X is usually 1, but is 2 for high level
Healers, Knights, Monks, and Priests, and low level Wizards; and is
3 for high level Wizards. This die-roll is modified by racial bonuses
or penalties:

Dwa Elf Gno Hum Orc
 -1  +2  +1  +1  +0

and the outcome may be subject to a further multiplier:

Bar, Val: x0.75
Hea, Kni: x1.5
Pri, Wiz: x2

It is possible (in the case of dwarves) not to gain power when gaining a
level.


Power regeneration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you use power, it slowly returns to its maximum level at a rate
dependent on your experience level (XL), role, wisdom, and intelligence.

Non-Wizards: every (38 - XL) * 2/3 turns
Wizards:     every (38 - XL) * 1/2 turns
(Or every turn if carrying the Eye of the Aethiopica):

regain d(((WIS + INT) / 15) + 1) power points.
