Potion messages and effects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from the WCST spoiler "spoil803".)

What happens when you (q)uaff a potion usually depends on whether the
potion was blessed, uncursed, or cursed.  If a monster can quaff a potion,
the effects upon the monster are documented below; all other potions won't
be quaffed by monsters. 

When a potion hits a monster, the monster will be awoken and has an 80%
chance of losing one hit point (but not killed), and then suffers the
effects described below.  If you didn't see the monster get hit, you will
be told, "Crash!".  Monsters are not angered by potions of (extra|full)
healing, (gain|restore) ability, speed, invisibility, water thrown at
gremlins, or unholy water thrown at werecreatures, demons or undead; other
potions will cause peaceful monsters to become hostile if you were the
thrower.

If a potion hits you, you lose 1 to 2 hit points and get the effects of
breathing vapors described below unless the potion has a specific effect
for hitting you.  You may also breathe vapors if you are near a potion
when it breaks (e.g., it hit a monster, was hit by a wand of striking, or
was kicked). If you are polymorphed into an unbreathing monster, the
vapours will get into your eyes for the same effect. If you are polymorphed
into a monster that neither breathes nor has eyes, vapours will have no
effect.

acid
  Cures stoning.
  If you are acid resistant, no effect.
    "This tastes sour." (not hallucinating)
    "This tastes tangy." (hallucinating)
  blessed
    You lose 1 to 4 hit points, and abuse your constitution.
      "This burns a little!"
  uncursed
    You lose 1 to 8 hit points, and abuse your constitution.
      "This burns like acid!"
  cursed
    You lose 2 to 16 hit points, and abuse your constitution.
      "This burns a lot!"
  hits monster
    The monster loses the same number of hit points as you would on
    quaffing the potion. Some monsters may resist.
      "<monster> shrieks in pain!"
      "<monster> writhes in pain!" (silent monster)
  hits you
    May be thrown by monsters.
    If you are acid resistant, no effect. Otherwise, same effect as
    quaffing potion.
