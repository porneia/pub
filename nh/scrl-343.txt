Scrolls are listed above by increasing price, then alphabetically.  The
COST field denotes the base price of each item.  WGT specifies the
weight (100 zorkmids weighs 1).

Scrolls comprise 16% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,
18% in containers, 22% on the Rogue level, and 1% in hell.  PROB is
the relative probability of each subtype.  Scrolls appear 1/8 cursed,
3/4 uncursed, and 1/8 blessed.

Scrolls of mail exist only if this ability was compiled into your
copy of the game, and if you have the "mail" option enabled.  When
new email arrives (or every 1999+d(3000) turns if playing on an
Amiga or DOS platform), the "mail daemon" will deliver a scroll of mail.
All of these scrolls are considered uncursed, and they cannot be changed
into another object in any way.

MRKR specifies the value used to determine the number of magic marker
charges needed to write a scroll of that type, or zero if it cannot be
written.  The actual number of charges used will be a random amount
from MRKR/2 to MRKR-1; if your marker has fewer than MRKR/2 charges,
you will be unable to attempt to write the scroll.

Wizards have a base 1/3 chance of writing an unknown scroll, and all other
classes have a base 1/15 chance; your chance generally improves with
higher luck, to a maximum of about 98% for Wizards and 32% for other
classes.  You can only write scrolls on blank paper, which can be made by
getting any scroll wet (except mail) or cancelling any scroll (except
mail).  Failure to write the scroll will cause the blank scroll to be used
up.  You can select non-blank scrolls to write on, but this will abuse
your wisdom and you will be told, "That scroll is not blank!"

Some types of scrolls have the same APPEARANCE when unidentified.  The
appearance of the remaining scrolls are are randomized from the following

Scroll messages and effects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from the spoiler "scrolls", by Ian Burrell.)

In order to read a scroll, you must either be unblind or know the
APPEARANCE of the scroll.  When a scroll is read, it will be used up
and disappear (except blank paper).  The effects depend on the blessing
of the scroll.  Non-cursed means either blessed or uncursed.  If you
are confused while reading the scroll, "you mispronounce the magic
words" and may obtain a different effect. Some scrolls have a different
message for "beginners"; a character is considered a beginner until
accumulating 2000 score points (1000 for Wizards).

amnesia
  All Sokoban maps are immune from the effects of amnesia.
  cursed or you are NOT confused
    You forget all of the current level.
  non-cursed and confused
    You forget 6/7 of the current level.
  In addition, if uncursed or cursed
    You forget any number of spells.
  In every case,
    You have a 1/3 chance of forgetting up to 25% of all known level
    maps and a separate 1/3 chance of forgetting up to 25% of object
    identities.
    You forget all traps on your current level, forget whether you are
    punished, and abuse your wisdom.
      "Your mind releases itself from mundane concerns."  (hallucinating)
      "As your mind turns inward on itself, you forget everything else."
        (your character's name is Maud);
      "Who was that Maud person anyway?"  (otherwise, 50%)
      "Thinking of Maud you forget everything else."  (otherwise, 50%)
    The scroll is (re-)identified.

blank paper
  You identify the scroll; it will not be used up.
    "This scroll seems to be blank."  (unblind)
    "You don't remember there being any magic words on this scroll."
    (blind)

charging
  blessed
    You identify the scroll and select an item.
      "This is a charging scroll."
    If the item can't be charged, no effect.
      "You have a feeling of loss."
    Otherwise, the item is charged by a larger amount (see wan1-343.txt,
    tool-343.txt, or ring-343.txt for specifics). Wands and rings may
    explode (see below).
      "Your <ring> spins clockwise for a moment."
      "Your <item> glows blue for a moment."  (unblind)
      "Your <item> vibrates for a moment."  (blind)
  uncursed
    You identify the scroll and select an item.
      "This is a charging scroll."
    If the item can't be charged, no effect.
      "You have a feeling of loss."
    Otherwise, the item is charged by a smaller amount (see wan1-343.txt,
    tool-343.txt, or ring-343.txt for specifics). Wands and rings may
    explode (see below).
      "Your <ring> spins clockwise for a moment."
      "Your <tool> glows white for a moment."  (unblind)
      "Your <wand of wishing> glows blue for a moment."  (unblind)
      "Your <item> glows briefly."  (unblind)
      "Your <item> vibrates briefly."  (blind)
  cursed
    You identify the scroll and select an item.
      "This is a charging scroll."
    If it is a ring, it loses 1 to 2 points of enchantment and may
    explode (see below).
      "Your <ring> spins counterclockwise for a moment."
    For other items, if it is blessed or has zero charges, no effect
    other than incrementing the recharged counter (although wands may
    explode; see below).
      "Nothing happens."
    Otherwise, it is set to zero charges. Wands may explode (see below).
      "Your <item> vibrates briefly."
  confused
    If your energy is at maximum, you gain 5d4 maximum energy.
    Your energy is increased to maximum.
      "You feel charged up!"

  Previously-recharged wands have a chance of exploding if you attempt to
  charge them further; wands of wishing will always explode, others
  have a chance depending on the number of times (x) recharged: 
  (x^3)/(7^3).
  PREV RCHG    %EXPLODE   %CUMULATIVE
  ~~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~~
      0           0           0

      2           2.33        2.62
      3           7.87       10.28
      4          18.66       27.02
      5          36.44       53.62
      6          62.97       82.83
      7         100         100
  When a ring with a positive enchantment is charged, it has an
  (enchantment before) in 7 chance of exploding.  Rings with
  enchantments of <= -5 or >= +7 will always explode when charged.
