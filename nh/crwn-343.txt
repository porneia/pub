Crowning and its consequences in NetHack 3.4
Compiled for 3.1.3 by Boudewijn Waijers.

When you pray a lot of nice things can happen. If you are in good
standing with your god ("piously aligned"; at least +20) and
sufficiently lucky ("extremely lucky"; at least +10), one of these
things is that you may be "crowned" by your god.

If this happens, you are not only granted a title (visible with
enlightenment or at the end of the game), but some other effects (most
of them beneficial) happen as well. The title you will gain is the
following:

Lawful:  Hand of Elbereth
Neutral: Envoy of Balance
Chaotic: Glory of Arioch

Then, you gain some useful intrinsics (if you didn't have them already,
of course):

* cold resistance
* fire resistance
* poison resistance
* sleep resistance
* shock resistance
* see invisible

Next, you may gain an item, depending on your class and alignment:

* Wizards will receive a (blessed) spellbook of finger of death unless they
  are already carrying one, or are wielding Vorpal Blade or Stormbringer.
* Monks will receive a (blessed) spellbook of restore ability unless they
  are already carrying one, or are wielding an artifact.

If these classes do not receive a spellbook, or for any other class:

* Lawful:  If you are wielding (as primary, if two-weaponing) a
           non-artifact long sword, it is changed into Excalibur if
           that does not yet exist in your game.
* Neutral: If Vorpal Blade does not yet exist in your game, it is
           created at your feet.
* Chaotic: If Stormbringer does not yet exist in your game, it is
           created at your feet.

If you received a weapon gift, it is blessed, unrusted and made
rustproof, and set to at least +1. If you received no gift (or you
received a spellbook gift of a spell that you already knew), your
currently-wielded (primary) weapon (or weapon-tool) receives the same
enhancements, and your skill in it is unrestricted. In all cases, your
skill in the appropriate alignment gift weapon is unrestricted whether
you got it or not: long sword for lawfuls and neutrals, broad sword
for chaotics.

There is, of course, a disadvantage to balance all this generosity:
after crowning, your average prayer time-out (the time you have to
wait between prayers) is greatly increased. So, if you already have a
decent weapon and the above intrinsics, being named is a BAD thing. If
you pray often enough, it WILL happen eventually, though.
