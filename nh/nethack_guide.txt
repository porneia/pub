1.What is nethack?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

NetHack is a single player dungeon exploration game that runs on a wide 
variety of computer systems, with a variety of graphical and text interfaces 
all using the same game engine. Unlike many other Dungeons & 
Dragons-inspired games, the emphasis in NetHack is on discovering the detail 
of the dungeon and not simply killing everything in sight - in fact, killing 
everything in sight is a good way to die quickly. Each game presents a 
different landscape - the random number generator provides an essentially 
unlimited number of variations of the dungeon and its denizens to be 
discovered by the player in one of a number of characters: you can pick your 
race, your role, and your gender.

Now that you have that wonderful piece of information, download it, and lets 
get cracking...

3. Map symbols and their meanings
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Half the fun is figuring out what does what in this game, and you will 
sooner than you'd think, but here are most of the basic map symbols. Be 
warned, there's a lot.

	--- Doors ---

All doors are marked in red, and are easily noted.

| = Open door, that has not yet been entered

+ = Closed door. Open it, kick it, or pick it's lock.


	--- Stairs ---

Stairs are marked in grey, and can be found pretty much anywhere.

< = Stairway leading up, be careful, sometimes you can not come back down.

>= Stairway leading down.


	--- Pets ---

As far as I can fathom, the pet you get is generated at random. Pets will do 
various things for you, such as fight enemies, find things, and get lost 
about every other second. Pets are shadowed in grey, and their characters 
themselves are in red.

d = Dog

f = Kitten

u = Saddled pony


	--- Items ---

Lots, and lots of items to pick up in this game. Be careful though, unlike 
all those fancy new RPGs, you can't cary 300 potions without being a little 
burdened.

e = jackal corpse(s)

>(teal) = weaponry

[ (grey) = weaponry

% (grey) = goblin corpse

% (green) = lichen corpse

* (grey) = rocks

$ (yellow) = Gold pieces.

? (white) = scroll

! (red) = Potion.


	--- Monsters ---

d (red) = jackal

F (green) = lichen

o (grey) = goblin

r (red) = sewer rat

x (purple) = grid bug

: (yellow) = newt


      --- Other ---

^ (red) = Trap. Watch out!

^ (purple) = Teleportation Trap

4. Stuck?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

It happens to the best of us, the worst of us. The entire point of the game, 
in essence, is NOT to get stuck. Needless to say, this section
might do you some good.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

"I can't get through the door!"

Well, you're probably just trying to open it (o). You might need to kick it 
down (k), or apply some lockpick tools (a). You might need to drop a few 
items to kick down the door, be forewarned.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

"I don't have enough stamina to move!"

Well, mr. college graduate, drop a few items you're carrying. Eat some food, 
or just..keep trying. You'll get the hang of it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

"I swear, I've uncovered the whole map!"

Well, you quite possibly could have. The biggest oversight, is not using 
stairways (< and >). If there aren't any useful stairs, look for un opened 
doors. If there are paths that seem to end in the open, use the search (s) 
command to perhaps open a new path, or search for new doors. Given enough 
time, it should work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stuck? Got a somewhat reasonable question? Fire me an e-mail at
jdude84@hotmail.com, subject=nethack. If it's not nethack, nethack question, 
or doesn't have the word nethack in it, it won't be read, which means you 
won't get a reply, so make sure you include the word nethack in the subject, 
got it? Good.
