Tools are listed above by category.  The COST field denotes the base
price of each item.  WGT specifies the weight (100 zorkmids weighs 1).
The existence of some items depends on options chosen when the program
was compiled; they are noted with an asterisk (*).

Tools comprise 8% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,
0% in containers, 0% on the Rogue level, and 12% in hell.  PROB is
the relative probability of each subtype.  See below for more details
on item generation.

If the CHG field is not blank, then the tool can be charged by a scroll
of charging or the Platinum Yendorian Express Card. The number shows the
maximum number of initial charges. An exclamation mark (!) indicates
that the tool can only be recharged once.

Finally, some items have a different APPEARANCE until they are identified.
Note that many tools share the same appearance with other types of tools.


Using containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Containers are generated uncursed, with the CONTENTS described below. 
Containers will not be generated containing tools, weapons, armour or
rocks. Containers in your initial inventory will be empty.  If the
container can be LOCKED, then there is an 80% chance that it will be
generated locked and a different 10% chance that it will be trapped.  Not
all containers FIT into other containers.  Some containers have special
EFFECTS.  All of the containers except ice boxes can be eaten by
gelatinous cubes; the contents will be engulfed but unharmed.
  CONTAINER       CONTENTS      LOCKED  FIT  EFFECTS
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~  ~~~~~~~
  sack            0-1 items     No      Yes  --
  large box       0-3 items     Yes     No   --
  chest           0-5 items     Yes     No   --
  ice box         0-20 corpses  No      No   Suspends rotting of corpses.
  bag of holding  0-1 items     No      Yes  May reduce weight.
  bag of tricks   1-20 charges  No      Yes  Bites you / creates monsters.
  oilskin sack    0-1 items     No      Yes  May prevent water damage.

Quantum mechanics may carry a large box containing either a live or
dead housecat named Schroedinger's Cat.  The state of the cat is not
determined until the box is opened.  There is nothing special about
this cat; it is just a silly physics joke. 

The weight of a bag of holding (wgt) -- including the 15 for the bag
itself -- depends on the weight of its contents (cwgt) and its blessed
status:
  blessed:   wgt = 15 + cwgt/4 + 1
  uncursed:  wgt = 15 + cwgt/2 + 1
  cursed:    wgt = 15 + cwgt*2

You may also lose items when you use a cursed bag of holding; each item
in the bag has a 1/13 chance of disappearing each time you apply or loot
the bag.

Putting any of the following (and ONLY the following) items into any bag
of holding will cause it to explode:
  (another) bag of holding
  bag of tricks (with non-zero charge)
  wand of cancellation (with non-zero charge)
It is sometimes possible to put one of these items into nested sacks
and/or oilskin sacks and then place them safely inside a bag of holding.
The chance of an explosion occurring then depends on the amount of
nesting:
  sacks:  0    1    2    3    4     5     6      7      8        n
  odds:  1/1  2/2  3/4  4/8  5/16  6/32  7/64  8/128  9/128  (n+1)/128

When a bag of tricks is #looted, it will bite you (1 to 10 hit points
damage) and become identified.  If you (a)pply it and it has charges
left, it will create one monster 22 out of 23 times, and create 2 to
8 monsters 1 out of 23 times.  "Nothing happens" when you apply a bag
with zero charges. Bags of tricks are generated with 1 to 20 charges.
If the bag has more than 10 charges, a blessed scroll of charging will
add 6 to 10 charges, otherwise it will add 6 to 15 charges; an uncursed
scroll will always add 1 to 5 charges.  Cannot be charged higher than 50
charges.

When ungreased bags get wet, their contents may also get wet.  Greasing
a bag will prevent this, but there is a 50% chance each time of the
grease washing off. A non-cursed oilskin sack will also prevent this;
if the oilskin sack is cursed, there is a 1/3 chance that the contents
can get wet.  Boxes and chests are all waterproof.

If a container (other than a bag of holding) is kicked, thrown, or
dropped from a height, fragile contents (glass items (other than
worthless glass) and eggs) may be destroyed. Kicking a locked large
box or chest may also break it open (see below).


Using unlocking tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each of the tools, wands, and spells listed below can be used for locking
and unlocking doors, large boxes, and chests.  Not all methods can LOCK
or UNLOCK.  DOOR and BOX represent the probability (in percent) of
succeeding each turn when attempting to unlock doors and large boxes or
chests respectively; it may be based on your Dexterity and you will fail
after 50 turns.  ROGUEs may get an additional percentile bonus for using an
implement (the numbers before and after the slash being added to DOOR/BOX
respectively).  The per-turn probability of picking the lock is halved if
you use a cursed credit card, lock pick, or skeleton key.  All unlocking
tools are generated uncursed.
  TOOL             LOCK  UNLOCK  DOOR    BOX     ROGUE
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~
  credit card      No     Yes    2*Dex   Dex     20/20
  lock pick        Yes    Yes    3*Dex   4*Dex   30/25
  skeleton key     Yes    Yes    70+Dex  75+Dex   0/0
  wand/spell open  No     Yes    100     100      0/0
  wand/spell lock  Yes    No     100     100      0/0

Using any of the first three types will exercise your dexterity, even if
you don't succeed.  Please note that a credit card has no special effects
in shops, although you can unlock a shop "Closed for inventory" and you
can buy and sell it like any other item.  If a watchman or watch captain
sees you pick a door with any tool, he may get upset; if he warns you
off, a trap is automatically added to the door in question.

Wands of opening and locking and the spells of knock and wizard lock
always work in one turn and can be performed from a distance.  Zapped
opening will also unlock doors in the same turn, will lower drawbridges,
and can remove a ball and chain (as will ringing the blessed Bell of
Opening).  Zapped closing will close a door in the same turn (if there
are no objects in the way; creating one if necessary) and will raise
drawbridges. 

You can also attempt to break a lock on a large box or chest by #forcing
it with a suitable weapon or kicking it open. This may EXERCISE your
dexterity or strength, but may also destroy any WEAPON you use, the
CONTAINER and/or some of the CONTENTS (possibly restricted to fragile
ones, namely glass items (other than worthless glass) and eggs):
  METHOD        WEAPON  CONTAINER  CONTENTS  EXERCISE 
  ~~~~~~        ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~
  Blunt weapon    No       Yes       Yes       STR
  Edged weapon   Yes        No        No       DEX
  Kicking         --        No      Fragile     No   


Using light sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Light sources are generated to stay lit for the number of TURNS noted
below.  They are GENERATED in the quantity and blessed state shown.
Cursed light sources will sometimes not light.
  LIGHT SOURCE   TURNS        GENERATED
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~
  tallow candle           200  1 to 7; 10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed
  wax candle              400  1 to 7; 10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed
  brass lantern  1000 to 1499  10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed
  oil lamp       1000 to 1499  10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed
  magic lamp       Infinite    25% blessed, 50% uncursed, 25% cursed
  potion of oil           400  1/8 blessed, 3/4 uncursed, 1/8 cursed
  Sunsword         Infinite    10% blessed, 80% uncursed, 10% cursed

Candles can also be applied to the Candelabrum of Invocation.  Brass
lanterns and oil lamps can be refilled by a scroll of charging; a blessed
scroll will refill them to 1500 turns, an uncursed scroll will add 750
turns to a maximum of 1500. Oil lamps with 1000 or fewer turns left can
also be refilled with potions of oil, getting twice the remaining turns
in the potion of oil. (Attempting to refill an oil lamp with a *lit*
potion of oil, or while the lamp is lit, will cause an explosion dealing
6 to 36 points of damage). No lamp can be filled beyond 1500 turns.

The artifact weapon Sunsword will act as a light source whenever wielded,
either by you or by a monster.

If you wish for a magic lamp, you will instead get an ordinary oil lamp.

Magic lamps never run out of power, and may summon a djinni and lead to
a wish when #rubbed.  Each time you rub the lamp, there is a 1/3 chance
that "You see a puff of smoke" and another 1/3 chance that "Nothing
happens"; in either case, just try again.

The remaining 1/3 of the time a djinni appears, the lamp is identified
and turned into an oil lamp, and one of five outcomes can occur.  The
relative chance of these outcomes depends on whether the lamp was
blessed, uncursed, or cursed:
  BLESSED  UNCURSED  CURSED  OUTCOME
  ~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~
    80%       20%       5%   Grants one wish, then disappears.
                             "I am in your debt.  I will grant one wish!"
     5%       20%       5%   Remains as a pet.
                             "Thank you for freeing me!"
     5%       20%       5%   Remains as a peaceful monster.
                             "You freed me!"
     5%       20%       5%   Speaks, then vanishes.
                             "It is about time!"
     5%       20%      80%   Remains as a hostile monster.
                             "You disturbed me, fool!"
NOTE: There is no way to get a wish from the djinni other than the first
outcome above.

There is a limit of 120 djinn per game.  Beyond this limit, they are
extinct and no more can be created.

Using instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All instruments are generated uncursed.  In this section, "nearby" means
within some distance from you that depends on your experience level.
Depending on your system, configuration, and options, sounds may also be
produced on your system's speaker.

tin whistle
  Wakes nearby monsters and calls nearby pets.
    "You produce a high whistling sound."  (non-cursed)
    "You produce a shrill whistling sound."  (cursed)

magic whistle
  non-cursed
    Teleports pets next to you.
      "You produce a strange whistling sound."  (not hallucinating)
      "You produce a normal whistling sound."  (hallucinating)
  cursed
    50% chance of acting as non-cursed; otherwise, wakes nearby monsters
    and calls nearby pets.
      "You produce a high-pitched humming noise."

horn of plenty
  Created with 1 to 20 charges. If more than 10 charges, blessed scrolls of
  charging add 6 to 10 charges, otherwise 6 to 15 charges. Uncursed
  scrolls of charging add 1 to 5 charges. Cannot be charged higher than
  50 charges.
  No effect if no charges.
  Creates some food (including royal jelly) or a potion of water, fruit
  juice, booze, acid, sickness, or oil.
  The blessed/uncursed/cursed state of the object produced is the same as
  the horn.

leather drum
  Awakens and may scare nearby monsters. Abuses wisdom.
    "You beat a deafening row!"

drum of earthquake
  Created with 4 to 8 charges. Blessed scrolls of charging add 2 to 8
  charges; uncursed scrolls 1 to 4 charges.  Drums cannot have more than
  20 charges.
  Creates several pits around you, and angers peaceful monsters in the
  vicinity. Awakens and may scare all monsters on the level.
    "You produce a heavy, thunderous rolling! The entire dungeon is
    shaking around you!"

bell
  Doesn't work under water or when swallowed.
  non-cursed
    Wakes nearby monsters and calls nearby pets.
  cursed
    There is a 1/4 chance of summoning a nymph (with no inventory), if they
    aren't already genocided or extinct. There is a further chance that the
    bell breaks, and/or that you are paralyzed or the nymph is made fast.
    Wakes nearby monsters and calls nearby pets.

The following instruments can be used to play notes to open the Castle
drawbridge. You will hear one "gear turn" for each correct note in the
right position and one "tumbler click" for each correct note in the wrong
position. However, if you improvise, you will get the EFFECT shown; some
monsters may resist.  Charged instruments are created with 4 to 8 charges.
Blessed scrolls of charging add 2 to 8 charges; uncursed scrolls 1 to 4
charges.  They can never have more than 20 charges.

  magic harp          May tame nearby monsters, exercise dexterity.


Using other tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unless noted, all items in this section are generated uncursed. Not all
of them are actual tools; a few items of other object types can also be
a)pplied.

beartrap or land mine
  If you successfully #untrap one of these traps, the trap becomes a tool.
  You can pick up the tool and later re-arm the trap at your current
  location by (a)pplying the tool.

bullwhip
  This weapon can also be applied to get yourself out of a pit, unwield
  or steal another monster's weapon, hit a monster, whip your steed into a
  gallop, or grab objects off the floor while levitating.

pick-axe
  You can dig by (a)pplying a pick-axe or dwarvish mattock.  Specify > to 
  dig downward (first makes a pit, then a hole), or a direction to dig
  through rock, walls, or doors, or to smash up statues or boulders.

axe or battle-axe
  These weapons can also be applied to chop down doors or trees.

cream pie
  You can apply this food item to blind yourself for 1 to 25 (more) turns.

eucalyptus leaf
  non-blessed
    Acts like a tin whistle (see instruments, above).
  blessed
    Acts like a blessed magic whistle (see instruments, above). Each
    use has a 1/49 chance of unblessing the leaf.

grappling hook
  You can apply this tool to grab an object at a distance, hit a monster
  (or, if small, drag it towards you), drag yourself in a direction, or
  hit yourself for 10 to 19 points of damage. If you are at least skilled
  in flail, you can attempt to choose between the first three options
  (with a 50% chance of accuracy if skilled, 95% if expert); otherwise,
  the effect will be randomly chosen. 

unicorn horn
  non-cursed
    Randomly fixes one or more of the following troubles: sickness,
    blindness, hallucination, vomiting, confusion, stunning, and loss of
    an attribute.  The approximate chances of fixing a certain number of
    troubles are shown here:
      # Troub:    0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7
      blessed:  22.7%  22.7%  19.5%  15.4%  10.7%   5.7%   2.6%   0.8%
     uncursed:  35.4%  35.4%  22.9%   6.3%    0      0      0      0
  cursed
    You get one of the following: illness, blindness, confusion,
    stunning, hallucination, or a decremented attribute.
  Unicorn horns don't fix stoning, sliming, strangulation, or wounded legs.
  #dipping a unicorn horn in a potion of blindness, confusion, or
  hallucination turns the potion into uncursed water.  Dipping it in
  a potion of sickness produces non-blessed fruit juice.
  Unicorn horns also make a fairly good weapon.  They are two-handed.

expensive camera
  Generated with 30 to 99 charges. An uncursed scroll of charging will
  add 10 to 20 charges, and then bring the camera to a minimum of 50
  charges. A blessed scroll of charging will add 15 to 30 charges,
  and then bring the camera to a minimum of 50 charges (75 if between
  51 and 74). A camera may never have more than 127 charges.
  You can get several humorous messages by applying it in certain
  situations.
  A cursed camera has a 50% chance of blinding you when applied.
  Otherwise, you can blind monsters.

mirror
  Cursed mirrors only work half of the time.
  You can get several humorous messages by applying it in certain
  situations (especially hallucinating; try underwater or at yourself
  while polymorphed into a floating eye).
  You can use a mirror to make a monster's gaze attacks work against
  itself (if the monster isn't cancelled):
    vampire or ghost   No reflection
    Medusa             Turns to stone
    floating eye       Paralyzed, if it is not invisible
    umber hulk         Confused
    nymph or succubus  Steals the mirror, if she is not invisible
  Otherwise, you have a 4 out of 5 chance of scaring the monster
  in that direction for 2 to 8 turns.  The monster cannot be a
  unicorn or humanoid, must have eyes and be unblind, and must be able
  to see invisible if it is invisible.
  Breaking any mirror (except by kicking a container) carries a -2 penalty
  to luck.

crystal ball
  Generated 1/4 blessed, 1/2 uncursed, 1/4 cursed.
  Generated with 1 to 5 charges. (If your Quest Artifact is a crystal ball,
  it is always generated with 5 charges.) Blessed scrolls of charging set
  the ball to 6 charges. Uncursed scrolls of charging add one charge, to a
  maximum of 5.
  Applying a crystal ball will cause you to be immobile (in a trance) for 1
  to 10 turns.
  There are several humorous messages if used when hallucinating.
  non-cursed
    You may look for an object, monster or symbol (including traps and
    portals, ^, but not stairs or other dungeon features).  There is an
    (intelligence in 20) chance of success; otherwise, you suffer the same
    effects as a cursed crystal ball.
  cursed
    One of the following happens: nothing, you are confused, you are
    blinded, you hallucinate, or the ball explodes (not if an artifact).

lenses
  These protect you from being blinded by ravens, spat venom or thrown
  cream pies. They increase the effectiveness of searching, and reduce
  the failure rate and time taken to learn spells from spellbooks.

blindfold
  You can controllably blind yourself by (a)pplying it or (P)utting
  it on.  A cursed blindfold cannot be removed by yourself.

towel
  You can controllably blind yourself (like a blindfold) by (P)utting
  it on.  A cursed towel cannot be removed by yourself.
  When (a)pplied, a towel can clean greasy hands (e.g., from a tin of
  greasy food) or clean a cream pie off your face.  A cursed towel has
  a 1/3 chance of causing each of these problems, or else it works
  normally.
  If you (E)ngrave with a towel, you can rub out writing in the dust.

saddle
  You can (a)pply it to a monster (equines, quadrupeds, dragons,
  jabberwocks, ki-rin or couatls) in order to be able to ride it in
  future. Chance of successfully saddling depends on dexterity,
  charisma, tameness of monster and riding skill; Knights receive a
  bonus, as does wearing riding boots or gloves.

leash
  You can (a)pply it to a tame monster to keep it nearby.
  Once you have leashed a monster, you can release it by re-(a)pplying the
  leash.  A cursed leash can't be removed by yourself, and moving too far
  from your pet may cause it to be choked and take damage.

stethoscope
  A stethoscope can be (a)pplied once each turn without taking any time.
  If you use it more than that, each application takes one turn.
  You can get several humorous messages by applying it in certain
  situations.
  A cursed stethoscope has a 50% chance of only hearing your own
  heartbeat.
  Otherwise, you can use it to find the status of adjacent monsters or
  of yourself or your steed (though this latter use may be interfered with
  if engulfed by a monster), and find secret doors and passages.

tinning kit
  Created with 30 to 99 charges. An uncursed scroll of charging will
  add 10 to 20 charges, and then bring the kit to a minimum of 50 charges.
  A blessed scroll of charging will add 15 to 30 charges, and then bring
  the kit to a minimum of 50 charges (75 if between 51 and 74). A tinning
  kit may never have more than 127 charges.
  You can convert corpses into tins.  The corpse must be uneaten and
  have non-zero nutrition.  The resulting tin is blessed/uncursed/cursed
  the same way as the tinning kit that produced it.  Blessed tins are
  not poisonous or rotten, and can be opened in one turn.  Cursed tins
  always contain rotten food.  Tins have the same chance of giving an
  intrinsic as the equivalent corpse; the blessed/cursed status of the
  tin does NOT affect the chance.
  Some people tin unique monsters as souvenirs.  You cannot tin the
  endgame Riders.

tin opener
  Mostly useless.  Wield the tin opener and you can e)at a tin in one
  turn.

can of grease
  Generated 5% blessed, 90% uncursed, 5% cursed.
  Created with 1 to 25 charges. If more than 10 charges, blessed
  scrolls of charging add 6 to 10 charges, otherwise 6 to 15 charges.
  Uncursed scrolls of charging add 1 to 5 charges.  Cannot be charged
  higher than 50 charges.
  When a)pplying a can of grease, you have a 50% chance of dropping it
  if it is cursed or you have fumbling.  Otherwise, you can grease an
  item to protect it or its contents from water or acid damage. If the
  can of grease is cursed or you specify no object, you get your fingers
  greasy.
  Greased outer body armour will protect against grabbing attacks,
  and greased helmets will protect against (master) mind flayer's
  tentacles; however, the grease has a 50% chance of wearing off after
  each attack against which it protects, and grease on cursed armour
  will only be effective 1/3 of the time.
  You can also use the can of grease or a potion of oil to #untrap a
  squeaky board.

figurine
  Generated 1/8 blessed, 3/4 uncursed, and 1/8 cursed.
  Applying a figurine creates that monster in an adjacent square of your
  choosing.  It will fail if the square is occupied, or if the species is
  genocided.  The chance of a tame or peaceful monster depends on the
  blessed state of the figurine:
              blessed  uncursed  cursed
    tame        80%      10%      10%
    peaceful    10%      80%      10%
    hostile     10%      10%      80%
  Cursed figurines can spontaneously transform when carried, after
  201 to 9200 turns in inventory.

magic marker
  Generated with 30 to 99 charges.  Can only be recharged once.
  An uncursed scroll of charging will add 10 to 20 charges, and then bring
  the marker to a minimum of 50 charges. A blessed scroll of charging will
  add 15 to 30 charges, and then bring the marker to a minimum of 50
  charges (75 if between 51 and 74).
  You can write scrolls and spellbooks from blank ones.  See the spoilers
  "scrl-343.txt" and "spl1-343.txt" for details.  The blessed/uncursed/
  cursed status of the resulting item depends on the marker and
  scroll/spellbook:
              blessed   uncursed  cursed
    blessed   blessed   blessed   uncursed
    uncursed  blessed   uncursed  cursed
    cursed    uncursed  cursed    cursed
  You can also (E)ngrave graffiti on the floor with a magic marker.


Invocation items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The three unique invocation items (Bell, Book, and Candelabrum) cannot be
placed in a container or destroyed in any way.  They have special effects
when (a)pplied or #invoked and you are NOT on the vibrating square:

Bell of Opening
  Obtained from your Quest Nemesis. Created with 3 charges. Blessed
  scrolls of charging add 1 to 3 charges, uncursed scrolls of charging add
  1 charge. Cannot be charged higher than 5 charges.
  uncharged
    Acts like a regular bell.  Will not break.
  blessed
    If you are swallowed, you are expelled.
      "<monster> opens its mouth!" (if animal)
    Else you unlock and open nearby containers and doors, find nearby
    secret passages and non-statue traps, open nearby drawbridges, and
    are unpunished.  Items must be in your visual range.
  uncursed
    If you are swallowed, you are expelled.
      "<monster> opens its mouth!" (if animal)
    Else same effect as a wand of secret door detection -- you find
    nearby secret doors, secret passages, non-statue traps, mimics,
    and hiding and invisible monsters.
  cursed
    If you are swallowed, "Nothing happens."
    Else you summon undead and wake nearby monsters.

Candelabrum of Invocation
  Obtained from Vlad the Impaler.
  blessed or uncursed
    The Candelabrum acts like an ordinary light source if at least one
    candle is applied to it.  It will last as many turns as the first
    candle that was applied would have burned.
  cursed
    The Candelabrum won't light.

Book of the Dead
  Obtained from the Wizard of Yendor.
  blessed
    Undead creatures in your sight are made peaceful; nearby ones sharing
    your alignment may be tamed, others may flee.
  uncursed
    No effect.
    "Your ancestors are annoyed with you!"
    "The headstones in the cemetery begin to move!"
    "Oh my!  Your name appears in the book!"
  cursed
    You summon undead.

To complete the invocation, you must be standing on the vibrating square
and have the non-cursed Candelabrum of Invocation with seven candles
attached (the candles can be any type(s), and even cursed), the non-cursed
Bell of Opening with at least one charge, and the non-cursed Book of the
Dead.  The Candelabrum burns out twice as fast when on the vibrating
square.  The Bell must be rung within 5 turns before the invocation.  The
Book must be read last.  Sascha Wostmann described a good way to remember
the sequence:
1. Make some light, to read by.
2. Ring the bell, to get the attention of an audience.
3. Finally, read the book.

Good luck!
