The effects of real-world time, date and moon phase in NetHack 3.4

NetHack is aware of the time in the real world (or, at least, what it's
told about it by your system clock). Certain particular times have
effects on gameplay.

Moon phases and dates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The date is only checked when the game is started or restored; if you
keep playing without saving, you'll continue to see the effects even
after the relevant period has passed (or not see the effects even
though it has been reached). NetHack divides the month into eight
phases of three or four days each: thus the full and new moon will be
reported for a rather longer time than your calendar might depict.

Full moon: - you have a chance of not being able to tame dogs at night
             (but you will still make them peaceful and you may try
             again).
           - your dog won't whine, yip, bark, or growl, but will always
             howl when you chat at it, at night (likewise werecreatures).
           - your baseline luck is increased by one.
           - werecreatures are usually in their wereform, especially
             at night.

New moon:  - there is NO effect on your baseline luck.
           - if you are hit by a cockatrice's or chickatrice's special
             hissing attack, and you are NOT carrying a lizard corpse
             in your main inventory, you will always start turning to
             stone. Normally, there is only a 1/10 chance.

Friday the 13th:
           - your baseline luck is decreased by one. Note that prayers
             will be rejected while you have negative luck, so until
             you manage to redress this, dangerous situations will be
             that much more dangerous.

If Friday 13th happens to be a full moon, the -1 and +1 to baseline
luck will cancel out. See gems-343.txt for more discussion of how luck
is calculated.


Time
~~~~
Night (22:00 - 05:59):
           - your chance of changing into a werecreature when you are a
             lycanthrope is 1/60 instead of 1/80 per move.
           - you have a chance of not being able to tame dogs when
             the moon is full (but you will still make them peaceful
             and you may try again).
           - gremlins can only steal intrinsics at night.
           - werecreatures can summon more easily.
           - your dog won't whine, yip, bark, or growl, but will always
             howl when you chat at it, when it is full moon.
           - werecreatures are more likely to be in their wereform,
             particularly when it is full moon.

Midnight (0:00 - 0:59):
           - undead do twice as much damage;
           - you get a different message when entering a graveyard
             ("Run away!  Run away!" instead of "You have an uncanny
	     feeling...").
