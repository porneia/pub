    <hr>

    <p>NetHack is, without a doubt, the best game ever written. There are
    many reasons for this. First, it's free. Second, it's more
    complicated and deeper than pretty much anything else. And third, if
    zipped, it almost fits on single 1,44 Mb diskette. How many games today can
    achieve all that?</p>

    <p>It is also one of the most difficult games I've ever met. I've
    only ascended (NetHack term for winning the game) it once. And I've
    played it for years. Ok, I suck, but it's also because the game is so
    difficult. Especially in the beginning. And that's why I wrote this,
    to help beginning players to get some idea what is going on, without
    spoiling the fun.</p>

    <p>If you have any comments/additions to this, please mail me (my
    address can be found in the end of this file). This guide is valid
    for NetHack 3.4.1, but most things should be correct for earlier
    versions as well. That I won't guarantee, however. And before you
    whine and complain to me, please read the disclaimer in the end.</p>

    <h4>First, some quick notes which can help survival a lot, not in any
    particular order (except the first one, which is very, very
    important!):</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>NetHack is not Quake. If there is a monster beside you, it
      doesn't mean you have to act quickly. Take your time and
      think!</li>

      <li>Don't get burdened. You want to be as fast as possible and
      being burdened slows you down. It's bloody embarrassing to fall
      down the stairs every single time, too. You can even die of
      that!</li>

      <li>Treat your pet with care. Gods like those who take good care of
      their pets. Besides, your pet is often a lot wiser than you are.
      And a lot tougher...</li>

      <li>Do not lean on keys. Learn the repeat command (n10s, if you use
      number_pad, will search ten times).</li>

      <li>Turn rest_on_space off. It can be very dangerous, when skipping
      messages during a battle. Pressing it more than enough will give
      the monsters free chance to hit you.</li>

      <li>Autopickup can be a dangerous option as well. Either turn it
      off or only pick up selected stuff like wands, rings and scrolls.
      You can also control it by using the pickup_burden option.</li>

      <li>Keep your eyes open. If you miss any messages, use Ctrl-P to
      read them.</li>

      <li>Do not shift-run. It will run straight into traps, push
      boulders and so on. Running with g-direction is safer
      (ctrl-direction with the vi keys or 5-direction on numpad).</li>

      <li>Leave peaceful creatures alone. They should not be killed
      unless there is a very good reason to do so. Usually you can just
      let your pet kill them.</li>

      <li>Try to remember what you have in your inventory. It's not fun
      to die when something you had in your pack would have saved you.
      Use the 'i' command often; it doesn't take any time.</li>

      <li>Put valuable and fragile things in safe containers. Holding
      multiple potions and scrolls in your pack just screams for a fire
      trap or a monster with fire attack to appear.</li>

      <li>Be wary when (q)uaffing from from fountains. Beginning
      characters usually just get killed that way. If you're low on hp's,
      leave fountains alone. Sinks too. Dipping things into fountains is
      much safer. Preferably cursed things that aren't normally affected
      by water.</li>

      <li>Read the Guidebook. It has loads of useful information, for
      example one good way for beginners to survive a bit longer. It has
      to do with engraving, but I'm not telling it: go read the
      Guidebook!</li>

      <li>If you can't find a stairway down, try (s)earching for secret
      doors. Each normal level has an exit down; special levels which
      don't have one are rare.</li>

      <li>Watch where you move those boulders; you might trap yourself if
      you accidentally block a corridor with a boulder. However, if you
      become stuck, strip naked, drop all your stuff and squeeze past the
      boulder. Then you can push it back.</li>

      <li>When you find a staircase down, go down and come up. If you
      happen to drop through a hole or trapdoor, you'll know where the
      upstairs are. Some monsters will also be created on the next level
      so they will be easier when you go there with more experience.</li>

      <li>If you see something you don't recognise, use /-command. It
      knows all those odd monsters and items.</li>

      <li>When one turn away from death (you remembered to watch those
      hp, didn't you?) try to quaff un-identified potions, read scrolls
      or zap wands. Potions can be healing, scrolls can be teleport and
      that wand just might be wand of death. After all, there's nothing
      you can lose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Then, some more information about following topics:</h4>

      <li>Food</li>

      <li>Identifying things</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Choosing your character</h3>

    <p>It is a good idea to play a lot of random characters in the
    beginning. If you get stuck on one character, you won't see the whole
    picture of the game. For example, playing only priests with their
    ability to detect the cursed or blessed state of an object might make
    you too dependent on that ability. Play different classes to get the
    whole picture, then choose your favourites.</p>

    <p>There are, however, big differences in the survival rates of
    different classes. Barbarians and Valkyries are the strongest classes
    and so usually survive better than weaker classes. Lots of hit
    points, decent equipment and strength to use it. Samurai are not bad
    either.</p>

    <p><strong>Archeologists</strong> start with a pickaxe (and should
    probably wield it, until they get a better weapon; a dwarvish
    mattock, that is) and a touchstone to identify gems.</p>

    <p><strong>Barbarians</strong> are strong warriors. They start with
    good weapons and some food. They are also poison resistant.</p>

    <p><strong>Cavemen</strong> are a weaker version of Barbarians. Not
    good, play Barbarians instead if you don't seek extra challenges.
    They, however, don't know why cannibalism is a bad thing and that can
    be useful sometimes.</p>

    <p><strong>Healers</strong> have some interesting equipment and
    spells, but are rather weak. They should have no problems getting
    food, though.</p>

    <p><strong>Knights</strong> have good equipment but are not really
    combat monsters. They can jump and turn undead. They have also a code
    of conduct to follow, which makes things complicated.</p>

    <p><strong>Monks</strong> are difficult, they are martial arts
    experts and should not use body armour or eat meat. Food rations are
    vegetarian, but you can't eat meaty corpses without a (small)
    penalty.</p>

    <p><strong>Priests</strong> can identify the blessed/cursed status of
    objects. It is a very useful ability, but watch out that you don't
    get too used to it.</p>

    <p><strong>Rangers</strong> are experts with ranged weapons and can
    be very deadly from a long distance.</p>

    <p><strong>Rogues</strong> can throw multiple daggers in one turn,
    which is good. They can also be experts in two-weapon combat. They
    should use their daggers to kill just about everything, until they
    reach a level high enough to start to learn two-weapon combat.</p>

    <p><strong>Samurai</strong> can fight with two weapons too and are
    strong warriors. They probably should start fighting with two weapons
    immediately to learn it. Only when it's really important to hit
    something, use one weapon.</p>

    <p><strong>Tourists</strong> are a slightly curious bunch. They have
    lots of money and food but not much else. They are one of the most
    difficult characters to start with.</p>

    <p><strong>Valkyries</strong> are the best choice for newbies, they
    are the strongest warriors and survive easily. Also, growing up in a
    cold climate has made them cold resistant (I wish I was cold
    resistant too, but Finland is not cold enough for that, I guess.)</p>

    <p><strong>Wizards</strong> start now with the force bolt spell,
    which increases their chances of survival. Still, they are not the
    easiest class to start with.</p>

    <p>Don't care too much about the race of your character. It has
    little impact on beginner's playing. Humans are the basic choice,
    other races have some benefits (infravision, mostly). Dwarves are ok
    for warrior types, elves for wizards. Being a dwarf or gnome makes
    the Gnomish Mines a lot easier.</p>

    <h3>Food</h3>

    <p>One thing that kept killing me in my early NetHack days was
    starvation. Many characters start without any food at all and it
    won't take very long to get hungry. After you're hungry, you get weak
    and sooner or later you'll be fainting and finally starving to death.
    Where to find food?</p>

    <p>Well, there's pretty much food just lying around. If you're
    getting hungry and the level in which you currently are is empty of
    food, try going down a level, there might be some food.</p>

    <p>One option is to kill something and eat it. However, while eating
    some corpses might give you certain benefits, eating some corpses
    will give you nothing but food poisoning. A few rules of thumb are a)
    eat your corpses fresh and b) your pet knows certain things better
    than you. Don't eat anything your pet won't. It'll keep you out of
    the worst trouble. Also remember, some corpses are more filling than
    others and some are worth saving for later.</p>

    <p>There also one way to get your stomach content, but that should be
    left to the uttermost emergencies. If you have a healthy relationship
    with your god, praying will fill your stomach if you are in real
    need. However, one should not pray too often. Gods get angry and when
    they are angry, mere mortals should beware. So, save praying for food
    to those situations where it's a choice of praying or dying.</p>

    <h3>Identifying things</h3>

    <p>One of the first things you might notice is that you have little
    clue what different items do. The item descriptions are always
    randomized, so for example oval amulets are usually not what they
    were in previous games. However, all oval amulets in a single game
    are the same. This same principle works for all magical objects (but
    not for weapons and similar stuff, 'crude dagger' is always 'orcish
    dagger'), of course.</p>

    <p>One way to identify items is to use them. Put on some armour and
    see what it does to your AC. Wield a weapon and look how easily the
    monsters die. However, it's not a way I'd recommend. Armour might be
    cursed. That amulet you try might just be a cursed amulet of
    strangulation. Whoops, you just died. The safest and the best way is
    a spell of identify (usually from a scroll of identify) which will
    identify at least one item in your inventory, sometimes even more.
    The scroll of identify itself is rather easy to identify; it is the
    cheapest scroll available, usually costing about 20-30 gold. The
    price can vary a lot, though.</p>

    <p>Amulets and rings are pretty to safe to try on if you know that
    they are not cursed. If they cause anything hazardous, just take them
    off (though, I'd take rings off if they don't do anything useful
    immediately; they might cause some big surprises...) Same goes for
    armour and weapons. Wands can be identified when you engrave with
    them and rings can be dropped in sinks. However, wand loses a charge
    when you engrave with it and ring is lost in the sink. If you don't
    know what the message you get means, you've just lost something you
    could have used. Another tip for engravers: engrave something first
    with your fingers!</p>

    <p>Sometimes, you don't identify a thing but are instead asked for a
    name to call it. You can also name items yourself, just use command
    #name. If you don't name just a single item, the whole class of items
    gets named. That is useful for example if you identify a wand when
    you engrave with it but the game doesn't identify it for you. Just
    #name the item class yourself.</p>

    <p>There are some easy ways to figure out the blessed/cursed state of
    objects. If something is cursed, your pet won't step on it, or "moves
    only reluctantly". Also, if you drop things on an altar, it will tell
    whether they are cursed or blessed.</p>

    <p>Remember also the '\' command, which gives you a list of what you
    already know. You might have seen a monster use something and know it
    that way.</p>

    <h3>Monsters to avoid</h3>

    <p>You shouldn't be killing everything you meet. That will most
    probably result in horrific deaths. Some monsters should be avoided,
    unless you have means to combat them.</p>

    <p><strong>Floating eyes (e)</strong> - these little eyeballs are one
    of my favourite monsters. They seem to be pretty harmless, but do not
    let their peaceful appearance fool you. They are deadly! Even though
    they can't damage you, attacking them might freeze you and then you
    will be killed by some newt or other passing monster. Yet they are
    useful to kill, for their bodies hold useful magical powers. They are
    slow, so you should just throw stuff at them (sharp and pointy
    things, rocks, glass, whatever useless stuff you have). Also, if you
    can't see them or they can't see you, they are safe to attack.</p>

    <p><strong>Nymphs (n)</strong> - do not disturb nymphs unless you are
    prepared (with ranged weapons or wands, that is). They steal your
    stuff and then teleport away. However, they won't usually leave the
    level so if you hunt and kill them, you'll get your stuff back.</p>

    <p><strong>Leprechauns (l)</strong> - leprechauns are similar to
    nymphs, but instead of stealing equipment, they steal money. They are
    annoying, but the easy way to handle them is to drop all your money
    (or put it in a sack) and then go and beat them.</p>

    <p><strong>Rothes (q)</strong> - rothes are dangerous to beginning
    characters. Their attack does lots of damage, mostly because they
    attack many times in a round. Besides, they usually appear in groups.
    Watch out for them. A good tactic to employ is the
    retreat-into-a-corridor-trick. If there's a group of monsters trying
    to kill you, retreat into a corridor where only one of them can
    attack you at time.</p>

    <p><strong>Fungi (F), molds (P), blobs (b), jellies (j)</strong> -
    while most of these are pretty harmless, some of them can do
    surprising amounts of damage to beginning characters. Also, they
    might be acidic and corrode your weapon. Avoid them, kill them from a
    distance. They are very slow if they move at all.</p>

    <p><strong>Mimics (m)</strong> - if you see a shop and there are some
    items, which don't fit in the general content of the shop they are
    probably mimics. They are dangerous! They are slow, but do lots of
    damage. Especially as it's hard to flee from larger mimics. So watch
    out, they've been known to kill a lot of promising characters.</p>

    <p><strong>Ants and bees (a)</strong> - these won't appear in the
    first few levels, but when they appear, watch out! You're not
    probably ready to fight them. They are pretty fast, appear in groups
    and are a pain.</p>

    <p>It's also advisable to pick up all potions, scrolls and wands you
    see lying around. Even if you have no use for it, some monster just
    might. Intelligent monsters know how to use them and a puny gnome is
    a lot less puny if it zaps you with a wand of lightning. And if
    you've never met a monster with a wand of digging, you can't know how
    annoying *that* is!</p>

    <h3>Two stairs up/down??</h3>

    <p>A few levels down from the beginning of the game, you will find a
    level with two staircases down instead of one. The other stairs lead
    to the Gnomish Mines, which is a branch of the main dungeon. It is
    easily identified when entered, as it looks different from the normal
    dungeon. If you play a fighter character and have descended carefully
    enough so that you have about 50 hps, you might consider entering the
    Mines. Weaker characters should continue down the main dungeon and
    return when they are tougher. However, this is a playing style issue;
    some enter the Mines right away.</p>

    <p>The Gnomish Mines go down about 8-10 levels. Halfway down there is
    a town, where one can find some shops and a temple with a priest who
    has an 1 in 3 chance of being of your own alignment (you can donate
    money to him/her and use the altar to discern blessings and curses
    even if he/she isn't.) On the bottom level, there is some interesting
    stuff (mostly valuable gems).</p>

    <p>The second stairs up can be found deeper in the main dungeon,
    below the Oracle level. Oracle level has a large room with statues in
    the middle. The large room has smaller room in it, which has four
    fountains and Oracle, who gives minor and major consultations. Minor
    consultations are same messages than in fortune cookies, except that
    those given by Oracle are always true. Major consultation tell about
    bigger things in game and contain very important information which
    you need to know if you don't want to read spoilers.</p>

    <p>The second stairs lead to Sokoban, a puzzle which has four levels.
    There you have to push boulders into holes that prevent your access
    to upper levels. The last level has a prize (random one of two good
    and very useful items) waiting. It's worth a try, at least to pick up
    the food available on the first level. It's not required, however, so
    don't worry about it if it seems to be too hard or if you get stuck
    (a hint: if you get stuck in Sokoban, usually you can solve the
    situation by dropping all your stuff, then you can squeeze behind the
    boulders).</p>

    <p>There are other branches and special levels, but if you can reach
    them, this guide is not for you.</p>

    <h3>Immortality</h3>

    <p>This ever-so-desired state can be achieved in this game. There are
    few ways, but the most reliable is the explore mode. Just press X and
    answer yes to the question. Ta-daa! You are now immortal. You won't
    get your score recorded, but that's a small price to pay.</p>

    <p>Indeed, if you ever feel like quitting playing when you've died
    once or twice too often, try explore mode. You can freely experiment
    on various things (especially if you start game with 'nethack -X',
    when you will get a wand of wishing), without the fear of the error
    part of trial and error leading to an early doom.</p>

    <p>Using the command "nethack -u wizard -D" ("nethack -uwizard -D" in
    Unix systems, however, only certain users are allowed to do that) to
    start the game, you will get wizard mode. It's like explore, but you
    get unlimited wishes, teleport, magic mapping, identify, create
    monster and other goodies. It is a good way to experiment with
    things.</p>

    <h3>The Dev Team thinks of everything</h3>

    <p>Most things have multiple uses, many of which you probably
    wouldn't think of. Try to do unexpected things and get unexpected
    results. For example, the towel. You've read "The Hitch Hiker's Guide
    to the Galaxy", haven't you? A towel is a very useful item, in many
    different ways. As the proverb says, "The Dev Team thinks of
    everything". They certainly do...</p>

    <h3>More information</h3>

    <p>Maybe the single best source for information is the newsgroup, <a
    href="news://rec.games.roguelike.nethack">
    rec.games.roguelike.nethack</a>. There you can find lots of
    experienced players and source divers, who can tell you anything you
    want to know about the game. However, before asking questions there,
    check the guidebook. If your question is answered there, you won't
    make people angry. NetHackers are usually quite a jolly bunch, but
    it's annoying to answer the same questions again and again.</p>

    <p>The official NetHack site is <a href="http://www.nethack.org/">
    http://www.nethack.org/</a>. The latest versions of the official
    binaries and sources are available there.</p>

    <p>Maybe the best source for NetHack information is Kate Nepveu's <a
    href="http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/">
    http://www.steelypips.org/nethack/</a>, which has lots of links to
    spoilers and other information and all of it is layed out clearly
    and without unnecessary decorations.</p>

    <p>Of course, the best source of information is the NetHack source
    code. It takes a little knowledge about programming in general to
    understand, but there are maps (Sokoban, all the Quest levels,
    endgame levels and so on) and other data files you might like to take
    a look at.</p>

    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>

    <p>I refuse any responsibility and so on. I am no NetHack god, just a
    mere demigod (I have only ascended one character). Instead, I'm
    rather experienced in dying with low level characters, which I think
    is more than enough for me to write this guide. This is merely
    intended to guide some beginners into safer waters, more experienced
    players will surely do things in different ways.</p>
