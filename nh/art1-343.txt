Artifacts are listed above by alignment, then alphabetically with the
Quest Artifacts listed later.  The name of each ARTIFACT may have been
abbreviated to fit in the table above; see below for the official name.
Artifacts are special instances of ordinary objects, and have all of the
behaviors and properties of the ordinary ITEM in addition to those
granted by the particular artifact; they are however considerably more
valuable, as indicated by the COST field.

The GENER field specifies all of the possible ways that a particular
artifact may be generated.  Each artifact can only be generated _once_
per game -- it cannot be generated again, even if the player never found
the artifact, if the artifact is stolen, or if the artifact is destroyed.
Note that in some cases, an ordinary object may be converted into an
artifact, but no artifact will be converted into another artifact.  The
meaning of the letters are as follows:
 a  Humanoid angelic species have a 5% chance of being generated with a
    blessed, rustproof Demonbane or Sunsword; 100% for Archons.
 b  All artifacts on the current level are saved when a character dies
    and creates a bones file.  If a new character visits the same level
    and loads the bones file, the same artifacts will be created, except
    under the following conditions.  If the artifact was already created
    in the new player's game or is the new player's Quest Artifact, then
    the artifact reverts to its ordinary object.  The Unique Items
    (Bell of Opening, Candelabrum of Invocation, Book of the Dead, and
    Amulet of Yendor) will revert into ordinary objects (cursed bell,
    pile of used candles, cursed spellbook of blank paper, and cursed
    fake amulet of Yendor, respectively).
 c  If you pray and your god is very pleased, you may be crowned and get
    a good artifact, though Wizards and Monks may instead receive a
    spellbook of finger of death or restore ability respectively.  If a
    lawful character is wielding an ordinary long sword when crowned, it
    becomes Excalibur.  Neutrals get Vorpal Blade, regardless of what they
    are wielding (if already wielding it, it goes "snicker-snack!").
    Chaotics get Stormbringer, regardless of what they are wielding.  You
    can only be crowned once.  If you were restricted to unskilled in the
    weapon class of your alignment's artifact, the restriction is removed
    so you may advance to basic skill.
 d  If you #dip a single ordinary long sword in a fountain, are at least
    experience level 5, and Excalibur doesn't already exist in your game,
    then there is a 1/6 chance of something special happening to your
    long sword.  If you are lawful, the long sword is converted into
    the blessed, rustless, uncorroded, damageproof Excalibur and you
    exercise your wisdom.  If you are neutral or chaotic, your long
    sword is cursed, loses its rustproofing, may lose an enchantment,
    and you abuse your wisdom.
 g  This Unique Item is an essential part of the game, and can only be
    obtained by killing (or stealing it from) the appropriate Nemesis.
    These items are specially protected from being destroyed.  They
    also do not count toward the number of artifacts that have been
    generated.
 n  An ordinary item can be converted into this artifact by #naming it.
    The item must be singular, not already an artifact, of the same type
    as the new artifact, and the new artifact must not already exist.
    Answer that you want to #name a single item, and provide the short
    name of the artifact (i.e. "Sting" instead of "elven dagger named
    Sting").
 o  This item may be given (non-cursed, and erodeproof if applicable) as
    a gift from your god when #offering corpses.  You must sacrifice a
    fresh corpse at a co-aligned altar, be in good standing with your god,
    have non-negative luck, and be at least experience level 3. You will
    only get artifacts that are of your alignment or none, and some
    classes get certain artifacts as their first gift (if available).
    Your first gift will always be co-aligned.
    Orcs will never receive elven weapons, or vice versa.
    The chance that you will be given a gift depends on the number of
    artifacts already created in the game and how many of them were
    gifts; the chance is 1/(10+(2*artifacts*gifts)).
    If you receive a weapon artifact this way and were restricted in
    its weapon class to unskilled, the restriction is removed so you
    may advance to basic skill.
 r  This artifact may be randomly generated in place of a regular item
    (1/20 chance for each weapon).  In particular, antique weapons
    outlets appear to frequently carry artifacts because a large number
    of weapons are randomly generated there.  The player-monsters on the
    Astral Plane also have a 50% chance that the weapon they are
    generated will be upgraded to one of these random artifacts.
 q  This is a Quest Artifact.  If you are of the same class as the
    artifact, you can only obtain it by completing your Quest.
    Otherwise it can only be obtained by bones levels or wishing.
    If you are neither the same class nor the same alignment, you cannot
    pick it up, wield it, or wear it.
 w  This artifact can be wished for.  You may specify either the short
    name of the artifact (e.g. "Magicbane") or the long name ("athame
    named Magicbane"); capitalization does not matter.  You cannot wish
    for Unique Items or your own Quest Artifact; there are also
    limitations on wishing for other classes' Quest Artifacts based on
    your class and alignment (see "q" above).  The chance of getting an
    artifact from each wish depends on the number of artifacts already
    created in the game:
        ARTIFACTS   0     1     2     3    4    5    6      n
        CHANCE     100%  100%  2/3   2/4  2/5  2/6  2/7  2/(n+1)

The first letter of the ALN column indicates the alignment of the artifact
(Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic), if any.  When playing a class which can have
multiple alignments, the alignment of the Quest Artifact will be adjusted
to match the character's starting alignment.  A second letter specifies
the class aligned to the artifact; alignments of these artifacts will also
be adjusted if necessary. It also indicates which Quest Artifact belongs
to each class, and for artifacts available as sacrifice gifts denotes that
the artifact is the guaranteed first gift for that class.  Intelligent
artifacts are indicated with a ! symbol.  All three conditions are
considered each time you attempt to wish for, pick up, wield, wear,
invoke, apply, or steal an artifact:
 *  If the artifact is intelligent, then in order to touch the artifact
    safely, you must have the same alignment as the artifact, must be of
    the same class (or no class is specified), must have non-negative
    alignment, and must not be in the form of something the artifact
    specially attacks. Otherwise, you will be blasted by the artifact's
    power, sustain 4d10 damage (2d10 if you have magic resistance), and
    abuse your wisdom.
    If you are of the wrong class and fail at least one of the other
    conditions above, then the artifact will furthermore "evade your
    grasp!" and you will not be able to use it at all.  
 *  If the artifact is not intelligent, then you have only a 1/4 chance
    of being blasted if you have a different alignment from the artifact
    or have negative alignment (these two criteria not applying for
    unaligned artifacts), or are in the form of something the artifact
    specially attacks; damage is 4d4 (2d4 if you have magic resistance).
    In any case, you will be able to use the artifact.
 *  Orcrist and Sting will never blast non-orcs.
Intelligent artifacts furthermore have an 80% chance of resisting being
cursed by "malignant aura"-type curses.

The +HIT column specifies any bonuses when calculating to-hit, and +DAM
lists any bonuses or multiplier to damage.  For some artifacts, these
adjustments only apply when hitting a specific type of monster.  See
weap-343.txt to find out how these values are used in weapons calculations.
Additional damage due to level drain, bisecting, or beheading are not
included in the table above, but are listed in the weapon descriptions
below.  Note that the chance of certain weapon artifact effects are
based on your to-hit die roll.  This means that if you always hit a
monster, the effect occurs with the published percentage; however, if
you only hit a monster 1 in 20, then every hit you make causes the effect.

The ATTACK and DEFEND fields list a brief summary of the offensive and
defensive effects of each artifact; see the sections below for full
descriptions of each artifact's abilities.  The effects of the Bell of
Opening, Candelabrum of Invocation, and Book of the Dead are documented
in tool-343.txt.  The powers of the Amulet of Yendor are listed in
amul-343.txt.
