Special rooms, shops, and level sounds in NetHack 3.4
Compiled by Dylan O'Donnell <psmith@spod-central.org>.

This spoiler only considers the special rooms that can be generated
randomly in the main Dungeons of Doom. Certain special levels have
their own predefined special rooms (shops in Minetown and the Tourist
Quest, zoos in Sokoban and the Wizard's Tower, and many others).


Special rooms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The usual name describing the room is given first, then in brackets
the chance of creation, the range of Dungeon Levels within the
Dungeons of Doom in which the room is eligible to be created, and any
other constraints on generation. Following this is a list of messages
(level sounds) which may be given when on a level which has that room,
and messages given when entering the room (as opposed to greetings
from its occupant, if any).

The chances listed are cumulative; once one type of special room has
been created, no others are eligible to be created, and they are
considered in order. No special rooms from this list will be created
on the Oracle, Big Room, Rogue, Medusa or Castle levels.


Shop (3/DL, DL 2+, not below Medusa, suitable room)
  "You hear someone cursing shoplifters."
  "You hear the chime of a cash register."
  "You hear Neiman and Marcus arguing!" (hallucinating)

  what that stock may consist of.

  (according to depth) from the classes koCDGHT and bugbears.

     alignment to altar)

  If in a co-aligned temple and your alignment is better than -4, you

  the temple will not attack you directly (although they can still use

Shops
~~~~~

Shops have a base 3/DL chance of being created between level 2 and
Medusa, provided there is a suitable room to put them in (no stairs,
only one door), and provided that there are enough rooms on the level
to start with (minimum 3, 4 for a branch level). Note that this means
that there will always be a shop on each of levels 2 and 3 if the
conditions are right (which in practice turns out to only be the case
about 45% of the time).

There are eleven types of shop; of these, one (lighting) can only
appear in Minetown. Their probabilities of random creation and their
stock distribution are:

SHOP                            PROB  STOCK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:~~~~~:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
general                        : 44% : 100% random
used armor dealership          : 14  : 90% armour, 10% weapons
second-hand bookstore          : 10  : 90% scrolls, 10% spellbooks
liquor emporium                : 10  : 100% potions
antique weapons outlet         :  5  : 90% weapons, 10% armour
delicatessen                   :  5  : 83% food, 5% fruit juice, 5% water,
                               :     :  4% booze, 3% ice box
jewelers                       :  3  : 85% rings, 10% gems, 5% amulets
quality apparel and accessories: *3  : 90% wands, 5% leather gloves,
                               :     :  5% elven cloak
hardware store                 :  3  : 100% tools
rare books                     : *3  : 90% spellbooks, 10% scrolls
lighting store                 :  0  : 40% tallow candle, 32% wax candle,
                               :     :  10% oil lamp, 5% brass lantern,
                               :     :  3% magic lamp

PROB is the percentage chance of a random shop being of this type.
Shops with probabilities marked * may not be larger than 20 squares;
if they would otherwise be (about half the time), they are converted
into general stores instead.
