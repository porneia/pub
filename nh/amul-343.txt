Amulets are listed in alphabetical order above.  The COST field denotes
the base price of each amulet.  WGT specifies the weight (100 zorkmids
weighs 1).

Amulets comprise 1% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,
1% in containers, and 4% in hell.  PROB is the relative probability of
each subtype; the suffix specifies the chance of blessed/cursed:
    c           0.5% blessed, 9% uncursed, 90.5% cursed
    otherwise   5% blessed, 90% uncursed, 5% cursed
Imitation Amulets of Yendor may be found on the bones pile of the Rogue
level (50% chance), with "double trouble" Wizards of Yendor when you
don't have the real Amulet (50% chance), and with the player-monsters
on the Astral Plane (100%).  The real Amulet of Yendor is carried by
the high priest(ess) of Moloch.

Except as noted below, the effects of amulets are controllable by
putting on and removing the amulet.  If the EAT field is Y, then it
is possible to obtain an effect permanently by polymorphing into a
metallivore (rock mole, rust monster, or xorn) and eating the amulet.
There is only a 1/5 chance of obtaining the effect this way ("Magic
spreads through your body as you digest the amulet."). Eating an
amulet of unchanging will not confer unchanging, but instead return
you to your natural form ("un-change" you).

The appearances of the first nine types of amulets are randomized from
the following descriptions:
    circular    spherical   oval      
    triangular  pyramidal   square
    concave     hexagonal   octagonal
Both the imitation and real Amulets of Yendor appear as an "Amulet
of Yendor"; they can be distinguished by identifying each individual
copy, naming the real one, or by placing each inside a container (the
real one will not fit).  The possible imitation Amulet on the Rogue
level is always pre-identified.


Wearing an amulet will increase the rate at which you get hungry
(see food-343.txt).

Amulet effects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
amulet of change
  When either worn or eaten, it toggles your character's gender between
  male and female.  Gender has the following effects in the game:
      Only female monsters can lay eggs.
      Eggs in a male character's inventory may hatch tame monsters.
      Males are seduced by succubi, females are seduced by incubi.
      Nymphs "seduce" males and "charm" females.
      The Cave(wo)man and Priest(ess) classes have different names.
      It determines how you are addressed (purely cosmetic).
  If you are polymorphed into a single-sex monster, your base gender will
  be altered but not your current one, with the exception that an incubus
  will change into a succubus and vice versa.
    "You are suddenly very feminine/masculine!"
    "You don't feel like yourself." (polymorphed into single-sex monster,
      but character's base sex has changed) 
    "The amulet disintegrates!"
amulet of ESP
  When worn, you will see monsters that have a brain when they are nearby,
  or anywhere on the level when you are blind.  If eaten, the intrinsic
  telepathy only works when blind. No messages.
amulet of life saving
  When worn, your life will be saved if you die; the amulet then
  disintegrates.  No message when put on. No effect when eaten (nice try).
amulet of magical breathing
  When either worn or eaten, you gain amphibiousness and unbreathing.  You
  can swim under water and cannot be strangled or choked.  No messages.
amulet of reflection
  When worn, rays from wands, spells, and breath attacks can be
  reflected.  No message when put on.  No effect when eaten (nice try).
amulet of restful sleep
  When worn or eaten, you will fall asleep within 1 to 100 turns. You awaken
  within 1 to 20 turns or when disturbed.  If you continue wearing an
  amulet of restful sleep, the cycle will repeat.  No message.
amulet of strangulation
  When worn, you are strangled to death in 6 turns.  When eaten, you
  instantly choke, with 1/20 chance of survival.  Exceptions are made
  if you have unbreathing from an amulet of magical breathing or
  polyself.
    "It constricts your throat!"
amulet of unchanging
  When worn, you are prevented from changing your current form by
  polymorph or other means, and are also protected from being slimed;
  any sliming in progress is halted. No message when put on. When eaten,
  you are "un-changed" to your natural form.
amulet versus poison
  When either worn or eaten, you gain poison resistance.  No message.
cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor
  No effect or message when put on.  Cannot be eaten.
Amulet of Yendor
  When carried, you get all of the following (mostly bad):
    You get clairvoyance, if it is not blocked.
    When casting spells, your energy is drained.
    Hunger is increased (additional to normal amulet hunger).
    Your luck timeout is increased.
    Monster difficulty will depend on your deepest level reached, not
    your current dungeon level.
    Monsters are less likely to be generated asleep.
    When going up levels in Gehennom, you may teleport down 0 to 3
    levels instead.  The chance depends on your alignment:
        UP    L      N      C
        +1  75.0%  75.0%  75.0%
         0   6.25   8.33  12.5
        -1   6.25   8.33  12.5
        -2   6.25   8.33   0.0
        -3   6.25   0.0    0.0
    You cannot level teleport.
    Teleportation within the level is blocked 1/3 of the time.
    The Wizard can teleport or level teleport to find you.
    The Wizard will try to steal the Amulet.
    You are permitted to enter the Plane of Earth by taking the upstairs,
    or quaffing a cursed potion of gain level, from dungeon level 1.
    You can activate the endgame portals.
  When worn or wielded, you get messages about the amulet getting
  "hotter" as you approach magic portals.  No message when putting
  on.  Cannot be eaten.  (Would you sacrifice yourself, then?)
