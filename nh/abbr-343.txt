NetHack, being the addictive game that it is, obviously leaves the player
vastly less time to write messages for newsgroups than would otherwise be
the case. As a result, the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.roguelike.nethack is
liable to be full of cryptic acronyms and abbreviations.

This document contains a list of all the more popular (and some of the less
popular) acronyms that you might find while reading the newsgroup. Some
people may consider knowledge of some of the item names mentioned to be
spoilers; such people are hereby warned. Acronyms and abbreviations in
common use across Usenet as a whole are not covered; there are plenty
of other FAQs out there that explain those.

A note on object abbreviations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following convention has become popular amongst many rgrn posters for
object abbreviations: the (ASCII) symbol used within the game to represent
the object precedes the abbreviation to make things clearer. So, for
example, a potion of confusion would be abbreviated to "!PoC". However, the
redundancy involved offends some people's sense of elegance, and you will
find both PoC and !oC (not to mention PoConf) as alternative representations
of the same item. Also, a lowercase 'b', 'u' or 'c' may sometimes be
prepended to the abbreviation to denote blessed/uncursed/cursed status; for
example, 'b?SoG' might be used to indicate a blessed scroll of genocide.

The lists below only include the items most commonly referred to by
abbreviations; but any object might be referred to by an abbreviation on
the same general schema (usually only once context for it has been
established).
