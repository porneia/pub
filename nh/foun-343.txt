Quaffing from fountains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any randomly-generated fountain will have a 1/7 chance of being "magic",
or "blessed"; there is no way to tell if a given fountain is magic or not.

Quaffing from a magic fountain, non-negative Luck:

3/10: Your hunger is reduced slightly.
        "The cool draught refreshes you." 

7/10: Your wisdom is exercised, and all your attributes are restored to
      their maximum (same effect as a blessed potion of restore ability).
      One attribute is increased by 1 (uncursed potion of gain ability
      effect); if your Luck is 4 or higher, this last effect will increase
      all your attributes by 1 (blessed potion effect). After this effect,
      the fountain is no longer magical.
        "Wow! This makes you feel great!"
        "A wisp of vapor escapes the fountain..."


Quaffing from a non-magic fountain, or magic with negative Luck:

9/30: Your hunger is reduced slightly. (Same as above.)
        "The cool draught refreshes you." 

9/30: No effect.
        "This tepid water is tasteless."

1/30: You see your attributes and exercise your wisdom (as with a
      wand or uncursed potion of enlightenment).
        "You feel self-knowledgeable..."
        "The feeling subsides..."

1/30:  You vomit and your hunger is increased.
         "The water is foul!  You gag and vomit."

1/30: If you are poison resistant, you lose d4 HP; otherwise, you lose
      d10 HP and d4+2 STR and your constitution is abused.
        "The water is contaminated!"
        "Perhaps it is runoff from the nearby <fruit> farm."
           (if poison resistant)

1/30: d5+1 water moccasins are created.
        "An endless stream of snakes pour forth!" (unblind)
        "You hear something hissing!" (blind)
        "The fountain bubbles furiously for a moment, then calms."
           (moccasins genocided)

1/30: A water demon is summoned. It has a 80+DL/100 chance of being
      hostile (100% if you have the Amulet); if not hostile, he'll grant
      one wish and then vanish.
        "You unleash a water demon!" (unblind)
        "You feel the presence of evil." (blind)
        "Grateful for his release, he grants you a wish!" (peaceful)
        "The fountain bubbles furiously for a moment, then calms."
          (summoning failed)        

1/30: A water nymph is summoned.
        "You attract a water nymph!" (unblind)
        "You hear a seductive voice." (blind)
        "A large bubble rises to the surface and pops." (unblind, water
          nymphs genocided or extinct)
        "You hear a loud pop." (blind, water nymphs genocided or extinct)

1/30: Each item in your inventory has 1/5 chance of being cursed outright;
      your hunger is increased and your constitution is abused.
        "This water's no good!"
      
1/30: You gain see invisible and your wisdom is exercised.
        "You see an image of someone stalking you.  But it disappears."
           (unblind)
        "You feel transparent." (blind, invisible)
        "You feel very self-conscious.  Then it passes." (blind, not invisible)

1/30: You briefly see monsters on that level and exercise your wisdom.
        "You sense the presence of monsters."
      If no monsters on the level (other than you), no visible effect.
        "You have a strange feeling for a moment, then it passes."
          (beginner not hallucinating)
        "You have a normal feeling for a moment, then it passes."
          (beginner hallucinating)
        "You feel threatened."  (not hallucinating)
        "You get the heebie jeebies."  (hallucinating)

1/30: You find a random valuable gem or piece of worthless glass and your
      wisdom is exercised. If you have already acquired gems or gold from
      this fountain, a nymph is summoned instead (as above).
        "You spot a gem in the sparkling waters!" (unblind)
        "You feel a gem here!" (blind)

1/30: Monsters on the level flee you for a while.
        "This water gives you bad breath!"

1/30: A number of pools may be created in your vicinity. (Never two
      orthogonally adjacent, never on your square, the more likely the
      closer to you.)
        "Water gushes forth from the overflowing fountain!" (pool created)
        "Your thirst is quenched." (no pools created)

Finally, the fountain has a 1/3 chance of drying up (except
in Minetown, where you'll always get one warning).


Dipping items in fountains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From art1-343.txt:

    If you #dip a single ordinary long sword in a fountain, are at least
    experience level 5, and Excalibur doesn't already exist in your game,
    then there is a 1/6 chance of something special happening to your
    long sword.  If you are lawful, the long sword is converted into
    the blessed, rustless, uncorroded, damageproof Excalibur and you
    exercise your wisdom.  If you are neutral or chaotic, your long
    sword is cursed, loses its rustproofing, may lose an enchantment,
    and you abuse your wisdom.

The fountain then disappears; this will anger the Minetown Watch
whether you've been warned or not, if that's where you happen to be.

In any other case, the dipping is handled normally. First, the object
gets wet and does the appropriate things (scrolls and spellbooks blank,
potions dilute, iron objects rust, lit objects go out, grease washes
off). Then special effects can happen (only 50% chance if wetting
object already caused an effect):

18/30: No special effect.   
        "A strange tingling runs up your arm." (1/18 chance)
        "You feel a sudden chill." (1/18 chance)
        No message (16/18 chance)

4/30: The dipped item is uncursed if cursed.
        "The water glows for a moment." (uncursed, unblind)
        "A feeling of loss comes over you." (item not cursed)

1/30: The dipped item is cursed outright.
        No message.

1/30: d5+1 water moccasins are created.
        "An endless stream of snakes pour forth!" (unblind)
        "You hear something hissing!" (blind)
        "The fountain bubbles furiously for a moment, then calms."
           (moccasins genocided)

1/30: A water demon is summoned. It has a 80+DL/100 chance of being
      hostile (100% if you have the Amulet); if not hostile, he'll grant
      one wish and then vanish.
        "You unleash a water demon!" (unblind)
        "You feel the presence of evil." (blind)
        "Grateful for his release, he grants you a wish!" (peaceful)
        "The fountain bubbles furiously for a moment, then calms."
          (summoning failed)        

1/30: A water nymph is summoned.
        "You attract a water nymph!" (unblind)
        "You hear a seductive voice." (blind)
        "A large bubble rises to the surface and pops." (unblind, water
          nymphs genocided or extinct)
        "You hear a loud pop." (blind, water nymphs genocided or extinct)

1/30: A number of pools may be created in your vicinity. (Never two
      orthogonally adjacent, never on your square, the more likely the
      closer to you.)
        "Water gushes forth from the overflowing fountain!" (pool created)
        "Water sprays all over you." (no pools created)

1/30: You find a random valuable gem or piece of worthless glass and your
      wisdom is exercised. If you have already acquired a gem or gold from
      this fountain, pools may be created instead (as above).
        "You spot a gem in the sparkling waters!" (unblind)
        "You feel a gem here!" (blind)

1/30 You lose some gold and your wisdom is abused. The amount you lose
     depends on the amount (GP) you have, as follows:
             GP <= 10    : 0 zorkmids
             GP <  100   : GP/10 zorkmids
             GP <= 10000 : d(GP)/10 zorkmids
             GP >  10000 : d(10000)/10 zorkmids
     Gems and gold can now be found in this fountain again.
       "An urge to take a bath overwhelms you."
       "You lost some of your gold in the fountain!"       

1/30 You find (2 * d(height + 1)) + 5 zorkmids, where "height" is your
     height above the bottom level of the current dungeon branch; your
     wisdom is exercised. If you have already acquired a gem or gold
     from this fountain, there is no effect.
       "Far below you, you see coins glistening in the water." (unblind)
      
    
Finally, the fountain has a 1/3 chance of drying up (except
in Minetown, where you'll always get one warning); 1/6 if wetting
the object caused an effect.


Other fountain effects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Digging down in a fountain square may create a number of pools in your
vicinity. (Never two orthogonally adjacent, never on your square, the more
likely the closer to you.) The fountain will then dry up (without warning
in Minetown).
  "Water gushes forth from the overflowing fountain!" (pool created)
  "Water sprays all over you." (no pools created)
Gremlins may multiply in a fountain (you can use the #monster command to
do so if you are polyselfed into one).
