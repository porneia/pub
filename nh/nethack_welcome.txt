rec.games.roguelike.nethack Welcoming Commitee presents:

    The Answers to all newbies who cry "where the heck I have
    ended up to?"

One page of information, with easily killfilable Subject line for
Power Users!

So, if you are a newbie and lost (as newbies usually are), here's some 
information that might help you to get started.



Welcome to the only real Nethack discussion area in the whole net!

To answer the first question, Nethack is a computer RPG based loosely
on AD&D(r) - a good game, we might add - and this group is here to
provide you means to reach other players and discuss about the game
and its variants. To find more information, here's some good sites
that have information about this wondrous waste of time:

http://www.nethack.org/
	This is apparently the Official Thing(tm). Not much
	information, but enough to get you started - and of course,
	this is where to get the offical binaries.
http://www.win.tue.nl/games/roguelike/nethack/
	The Nethack Homepage at win.tue.nl is one of the most
	voluminous sites. It has a lot of information about Nethack
	and its variants.
http://www.nethack.de/
       	Sascha Wostmann's most excellent site. This page is probably
	the best Nethack resource ever existed - not only it has all
	spoiler information you ever wanted, but also cool stuff that
	is not exactly related to the game - such as the Wall and
	quotes from folk in r.g.r.n.
http://www.spod-central.org/~psmith/nh/
	Dylan O'Donnell's updates to spoilers and other insteresting
	stuff...


Here's some information that a newbie really should know when they
come to the group:

http://www.melankolia.net/nethack/nethack.guide.html
	Absolute Beginner's Guide, by Mikko Saari.
http://www.nethack.de/spoiler/yanfaq.txt
	YANFAQ - Yet Another Nethack FAQ. This describes the basics of 
	the game, and some of the techniques that are often referred to
	in the group.
http://www.nethack.de/spoiler/32abbr.txt
	The most common abbreviations used in r.g.r.n. This answers
	probably the most requently asked question, "What does YASD
	mean?"
http://www.iki.fi/wwwwolf/games/nethack/postfaq.txt
	BeingFool-HOWNOTTO, or How Not To Make Yourself Look Like A
	Complete Idiot When Posting To rec.games.roguelike.nethack.
	Highlights some netiquette details you should be aware of.


Once again, welcome to r.g.r.n and have fun.
