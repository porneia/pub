Comestibles are listed above by category, then by increasing nutrition.
Japanese names of items are listed in parentheses ().  The COST field
denotes the base price of each item.  WGT specifies the weight (100
zorkmids weighs 1).

Food comprises 20% of all randomly-generated items in the main dungeon,
15% in containers, 22% on the  Rogue level, and 16% in hell.  PROB is the
relative probability of each subtype.  Eggs not laid by you have a
roughly 1/3 probability of hatching.  Tins are 1/6 spinach and are 5%
blessed, 90% uncursed, and 5% cursed.  All other comestibles will be
generated uncursed.

The nutrition of each item is listed under NUTR.  The cost of all items
are based on the nutrition by the formula COST = (NUTR / 20) +5, with
fractions rounded off.  Note that several previously archived spoilers
did not correctly round their costs.  The ratio of nutrition to weight
is listed in the NUTR/WGT column; lembas wafers have the best ratio.
The amount of time needed to completely eat an item is given under TIME.


Hunger and nutrition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from the spoiler "food" by Bryan Butler and J. Ali Harlow.)

Each of the following conditions is checked on the turns shown; if it is
the case, then you lose one more point of nutrition that turn.  Rings
and amulets cause additional hunger as shown; the only exception is a
ring that can be charged but is at +0. A ring of slow digestion prevents
base ordinary food consumption, but still causes ring hunger.  You can
therefore consume a maximum of 64 nutrition in 20 turns (if all of these
conditions were met).
  HOW OFTEN      CAUSE
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~
  Each turn      Ordinary food consumption, if carnivorous or herbivorous
                 and not wearing a ring of slow digestion. When asleep,
                 only about 10% as much is needed.
  Odd turns      Regeneration from anything other than an artifact.
  Odd turns      Encumbrance is stressed or worse.
  Even turns     Hunger intrinsic (e.g., from a ring).
  Even turns     Conflict from anything other than an artifact.
  Turn 4 of 20   Ring worn on left hand (except a +0 ring).
  Turn 8 of 20   Amulet worn.
  Turn 12 of 20  Ring worn on right hand (except a +0 ring).
  Turn 16 of 20  Carrying the Amulet of Yendor.

Naturally, eating some food will make you gain the amount of nutrition
in the food.  Your level of nutrition is described as follows:
  2000 or more           Death from choking (under certain circumstances)
  1000 or more           Satiated
   150 to  999           Not hungry
    50 to  149           Hungry
     0 to   49           Weak
  Below zero             Fainting
  Below (-200)-(20*CON)  Death from starvation


Corpses
~~~~~~~
(Adapted from the spoiler "corpses", by Boudewijn Waijers and
Peter Snelling.)

When a monster is killed, the probability of leaving a corpse depends on
several factors:
  PROB  CONDITIONS
  ~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~
    0%  Killed by digestion or disintegration.
    0%  Killed by stoning (creates a statue instead).
    0%  Corpses are never generated on the Rogue level.
    0%  Non-flesh golems leave objects instead of a corpse.
    0%  Some monsters never leave a corpse (e.g., Vlad, liches).
  100%  Lizards, monsters of large size or bigger.
  100%  The Riders and player-monsters on the Astral Plane.
   1/2  Frequent monster that is not tiny
   1/3  Monster appears infrequently or is tiny (but not both).
   1/4  Monster both appears infrequently and is tiny.
There is a further reduction of the above chances for undead creatures
that die on a graveyard level: by 1/9 if it was killed by you or by
1/3 if it was not killed by you (e.g., by a trap or another monster).  
This means that wraiths have a better chance of leaving a corpse if you
lead them to a stairway and let them follow you to a non-graveyard
level, a technique called "wraith luring". For this purpose, the
Castle and all levels of the Priest Quest are considered graveyard
levels, as is any level on which undead have been summoned by the 
cursed Book of the Dead or Bell of Opening.

The nutrition, weight, and time needed to eat corpses is determined by
the type of monster.  The blessed/cursed status of corpses adjusts how
fast they become tainted; corpses on an ice surface age half as fast,
corpses do not age while in iceboxes, and lizard and lichen corpses
never become tainted (though they do become too old for sacrifice).
Vampires, mummies, and zombies leave corpses that are already considered
old.  Tainted corpses do not provide either nutrition or intrinsics.

(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)

You can acquire useful intrinsics by eating certain corpses or tins.
The blessed/cursed status does *not* change the likelihood of getting
an intrinsic.  If the monster has more than one conferrable intrinsic,
one is randomly picked, with equal probability among all possible.
The CHANCE that the picked intrinsic is conferred varies among the
different intrinsics; some are based on the level of the monster (LEV).
If you get the intrinsic, you will get a MESSAGE (the second one if
you are hallucinating).
  INTRINSIC          CHANCE  MESSAGE
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~
  Fire resistance    LEV/15  "You feel a momentary chill."
                             "You be chillin'."
  Sleep resistance   LEV/15  "You feel wide awake"
  Cold resistance    LEV/15  "You feel full of hot air"
  Disintegration     LEV/15  "You feel very firm."
    resistance               "You feel totally together, man."
  Shock resistance   LEV/15  "Your health currently feels amplified!"
                             "You feel grounded in reality."
  Poison resistance  LEV/15  "You feel healthy."
                             ("You feel especially healthy." if you had
                             previously acquired non-permanent poison
                             resistance by other means.)
                             Note: 25% better chance if killer bee or
                             scorpion.
  Teleport           LEV/10  "You feel very jumpy."
                             "You feel diffuse."
  Teleport control   LEV/12  "You feel in control of yourself."
                             "You feel centered in your personal space."
  Telepathy           100%   "You feel a strange mental acuity."
                             "You feel in touch with the cosmos."
        
Some corpses or tins have additional effects:
  :bjDFNP  If you eat a lizard or any acidic monster, a possible stoning
           process is stopped.
           "You feel limber" (non-hallucinating)
           "What a pity - you just ruined a future piece of art!"
           (hallucinating with charisma <= 15)
           "What a pity - you just ruined a future piece of fine art!"
           (hallucinating with charisma > 15)

  :  Eating a lizard has the supplemental effect of reducing stunning
     or confusion timeouts to 2 turns, if higher.

  :  Eating a newt ("eye of newt") may cause you to gain 1 to 3 energy
     (2/3 chance, always if at two-thirds maximum energy or below). If
     this would take you above your maximum energy, there is a 1/3 chance
     that your maximum energy will be increased by one.
       "You feel a mild buzz."

  :@ Eating a chameleon or doppelganger makes you polymorph once.
     (Eating doppelgangers may also be considered cannibalism if you
     are human.)

  h  a (master) mind flayer has a 50% chance of increasing your INT by
     one. Otherwise, it confers telepathy.

  m  Eating a mimic makes you mimic a pile of gold (or, if hallucinating,
     an orange) for some turns, unless you have unchanging. The larger the
     mimic the longer you imitate. During this time, you are shown as a
     $-sign or %-sign.  If you are attacked, you revert to your previous
     form.

  yB Eating a bat will make you stunned for 30 (more) turns, or 60 (more)
     turns for a giant bat.  In theory, this also holds for yellow lights
     (but they don't leave corpses in recent versions).

  E  When you eat a stalker's corpse and you are not invisible, you'll
     become invisible for 50 to 149 turns. If you're already invisible,
     you become permanently invisible and get the "see invisible"
     intrinsic.  In both cases, you are stunned for 60 (more) turns.

  F@ If the monster has a stun or hallucination attack or is a violet
     fungus, you get hallucination for (another) 200 turns.

  H  Eating a giant, stone giant, hill giant, fire giant, frost giant,
     storm giant, or Lord Surtur will increase your strength.  If you
     had less than 18 strength, then you have a 19/24 chance of gaining
     one point, or a 1/24 chance each of gaining 2 to 6 points.  If you
     had 18 strength or more, then you gain 1 to 10 points (equally
     likely), or just one point if you had strength 18/85 or more, up to
     18/** (or your racial maximum if lower).

  P  Eating a green slime's corpse (unless polymorphed into a green slime,
     a salamander, a flaming sphere, or a fire vortex or elemental; or you
     have unchanging or were being slimed already) will slime you to death
     in 10 turns.

  Q  A quantum mechanic's corpse makes you toggle your speed.  If you
     were not currently fast, you'll get fast; otherwise, you lose the
     speed.

  W  Eating a wraith's corpse lets you gain a level (unless the corpse
     is rotten and rots away completely).

  df If you eat any of little dog, dog, large dog, kitten, housecat, or
     large cat, you'll get the intrinsic "aggravate monster" unless you
     are a Caveman or an orc.  "You feel that eating the <monster> was a
     bad idea."

  c@ If you eat a cockatrice, chickatrice, or Medusa's corpse and you
     are neither stoning resistant nor are you polymorphed into a golem,
     you'll be instantly killed by stoning.

  @hGK  Eating something of your own species (Kops are human) is 
        considered cannibalism unless you are a Caveman or an orc.  You
        get the intrinsic "aggravate monster" and lose 2 to 5 luck.

  @  Eating a were-creature makes you a lycanthrope of the same kind and
     may be considered cannibalism if you are human.

  @  Eating a nurse heals you up to max hitpoints and may be considered
     cannibalism if you are human.

  &  Eating Death, Pestilence or Famine is instantly fatal.


Tins
~~~~
(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)

You get up to 50 moves to open a tin; otherwise, you give up. If you are
wielding a tin opener, it takes one turn; any dagger or crysknife, 3
turns; or a pick-axe or axe, 6 turns. Failing this, if you have greasy
fingers the tin will be dropped (if carried), otherwise it will take
10+d(500/(DEX+STR)) turns to open (18/xx strengths being mapped to the
range 19-21).  Blessed tins "open like magic" in one turn.  Cursed tins
have a 1/8 chance of exploding and will always contain rotten food, so
they won't give any nutrition but will make you even more hungry. 

Tins made by you with a tinning kit are always homemade if not cursed. 
All other tins are one of these fifteen possibilities: pureed (500),
deep fried (60), homemade (50), pickled (40), soup (20), stir fried (80),
candied (100), boiled (50), dried (55), szechuan (70), french fried (40),
sauteed (95), broiled (80), smoked (50), or rotten (-50).  The number in
the parentheses is the nutrition value of each.  You cannot tell in
advance what type a given tin is.

When you eat deep fried or french fried food, you get slippery fingers
for up to 15 rounds, making you drop your wielded weapon.  You can shorten
the time by (a)pplying a towel.  Don't forget to pick your weapon up again.

You can obtain intrinsics from eating tins, with the same chance that
you would have from eating the monster's corpse.  Note that the chance
of getting an intrinsic does not change if the tin is blessed or
cursed.

One of the most useful tins is the tin of spinach. If the tin is cursed,
you lose strength equivalent to eating a giant corpse.  Otherwise,
eating the spinach "makes you feel like Popeye" (or Swee'pea while
hallucinating) and gives you more strength equivalent to a giant corpse.
Tins of spinach have a nutrition of 600.


Other food
~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)

Eating a sprig of wolfsbane cures lycanthropy.

A carrot cures blindness.  Ever seen a rabbit with glasses? (It won't
help with being creamed or envenomed, though.)

Eating a fortune cookie gives you a rumor. You can also just (r)ead it
without eating the cookie. The rumour is from the true file if the
cookie is blessed, the false file if cursed, or either if uncursed.

Eating a lump of royal jelly increases (decreases if cursed) your
strength by one. If the jelly was cursed, you lose up to 20 hit points,
otherwise you gain up to 20 HP and your wounded legs heal. If your
actual HP would become higher than your maximum HP, there is a 1/17
chance of increasing your maximum HP by one.

Eating a cockatrice egg is a real bad idea if you're not polymorphed
into something that resists stoning.  However, they are very useful when
thrown at monsters.

Eating green slime is also an extremely bad idea unless you're polymorphed
into something fiery or a slime yourself (or have unchanging).

Eating a eucalyptus leaf cures sickness or vomiting. They can also be
a)pplied to give the effect of a tin whistle (cursed or uncursed) or a
magic whistle (blessed; this has a 1/49 chance of unblessing the leaf).

Eating tripe may make you vomit (50% chance) unless you are a Caveman
or an orc, or polymorphed into a carnivorous non-humanoid.

In addition to eating them, cream pies may be thrown to blind their target,
or you can a)pply one directly to blind yourself.


Eating objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Adapted from a spoiler by Sascha Wostmann.)

There are some conditions before you can eat an object. If you are
polymorphed into a metallivore (rock mole, rust monster, or xorn), you
may eat objects made of metal.

If you are polymorphed into a gelatinous cube, the object is organic,
and the object doesn't contain other objects, you may eat it.  This is
different for real gelatinous cubes, which can eat a container and hold
the non-organic contents of that container engulfed.  So when such a
beasty eats your chest with all the artifacts, you may find them on its
corpse.

You can never eat Unique Items such as the Amulet or the invocation
artifacts.

Eating something that isn't actually food always takes only one move.
The code addresses this issue by stating, "[We don't want] to deal with
partly eaten plate mails, players who polymorph back to human in the
middle of their metallic meal, etc...."

Eating rings has a 1/3 chance of conferring the intrinsic of the ring.
Eating amulets has a 1/5 chance of having an effect.  Not all intrinsics
can be acquired this way.  See the spoilers "amul-343.txt" and
"ring-343.txt".

When you eat a leash with a monster on the other side, this monster gets
unleashed.

If you eat the iron ball or the chain while you are punished, the
punishment is gone. If you eat the chain, the ball is still available to
use as a weapon or to throw.

When you try to eat something rustproof while being polymorphed into a
rust monster, you spit it out non-rustproof and get stunned a few rounds.

Eating a poisoned weapon has the same effect as eating poisonous corpses.
You get poisoned if you're not resistant.

Eating a non-cursed trident exercises wisdom. (This is apparently a
US-centric pun having something to do with a brand of chewing gum.)
"That was pure chewing satisfaction!"

Eating a non-cursed flint stone exercises constitution. "Yabba-dabba
delicious!" (Note however that there are no monsters capable of eating
flint stones in the present version.)
