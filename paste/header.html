THIS PASTEBIN SERVICE IS PROUDLY POWERED BY SHORTLY
===================================================

Usage: delete this text and put your own instead; then click `Save'!

You can use this service without fear for your data to be deleted.  In
fact the server is unaware (i.e. has zero knowledge) of data you paste
here because all information is contained in the URL of your paste.
You can check this with any Shortly service around.  For example,
those two URLs will give you exactly the same result:

    http://porneia.free.fr/pub/paste/#C0ktLlHITVXwVM9VSEvMzS8tVgQA9
    http://lucaspiller.github.com/shortly/#C0ktLlHITVXwVM9VSEvMzS8tVgQA9

If you want to know more about Shortly, please check:

    https://github.com/lucaspiller/shortly

If you want to know more about URIs general syntax, please read the
ยง3.2 of the rfc2616 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt).

In case you want something with more features than Shortly, go check
ZeroBin by sebsauvage (PHP 5.2.6 or above required):

Have fun!
