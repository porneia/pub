<p>
The ukulele, or abbreviated to <em>uke</em>, is a chordophone classified
as a plucked lute; it is a subset of the guitar family of instruments,
generally with four nylon or gut strings or four courses of strings.

<p>
The ukulele is commonly associated with music from Hawai'i where the name
roughly translates as &quot;jumping flea&quot;, due to the action of one's
fingers playing the ukulele resembling a jumping flea. According to Queen
Lili'uokalani, the last Hawaiian monarch, the name means &quot;the gift
that came here&quot;, from the Hawaiian words uku (gift or reward) and
lele (to come). &ndash; Source: Wikipedia.

  <li><p>I am playing ukulele since few months now and I have to say that
    it is a great instrument. You can take it with you everywhere and have
    phun everytime you play. It's a good deal if you don't know music
    playing at all because it is very simple to start. For advanced music
    players, in couple of hours, you will discover a little instrument
    full of sensations. &ndash; illovae (april 2009)
