<p>
Packages X11User.pkg and X11SDK.pkg which provide X11 environment for
users and developers under Mac OS 10.4 (also known as Tiger) is
normaly available on the installation disc. But what happens if you
don't have yours around? Don't search on apple.com, they don't release
it. So we found somewhere on the Internet (sorry we don't remember
where) an archive containing both packages. We put
it <a href="http://porneia.free.fr/bin/tmp/X11TigerInstall.zip">here</a> <span class="littletxt">(zip,
59.8Mo)</span> if someone else's searching for it.
