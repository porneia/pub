A good time was had by all... and I forgot to take pictures until it
was time to clean up.  

We spent our time eating, drinking and shooting guns.

Appetizers were barbecued oysters... opened using a he-man shucker.

garlic butter, lime and Tapatio.

Caprese salad made with cherry tomatoes and those tiny mozzarella
balls.  http://i50.tinypic.com/344v8dz.jpg

I was to busy eating to take pictures of anything else.  We had
chicken and ribs, with skewered vegetables and something called
"Executive Potatoes.  It was pretty good for an occasional side.
Dessert was crepes filled with Nutella, strawberries and bananas
served with vanilla ice cream.  You'll just have to visualise it.
Nope, no chocolate drizzle - that would have been over the top.  
  ;)


Here is a recipe for one of those "I thought it was Mom's recipe" type
things.  Son-in-Law mentioned it to DD as something he'd like to serve
yesterday, but didn't have his grandmother's recipe.  Surprise,
surprise Daughter found several on the internet and the one she picked
tasted "just like Grandma's"!  I don't know which one she picked.
They looked pretty much alike to me, so here's one that didn't call
for microwaved potatoes.


Executive Potatoes

did.
