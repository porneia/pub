Who knew that martinis could hit two totally different taste buds? Both
of these are such fun - and EASY - recipes! 

Sour: Tang Tart Martini

-	1 part ABSOLUT Citron Vodka
-	1 part Hiram Walker Tangerine Schnapps
-	1 part lemon juice
Shake and strain into martini glass, garnish with lemon peel. 

Sweet: Butter Kat Martini
--- There's chocolate involved, enough said!  
-	1 part ABSOLUT Vanilia Vodka 
-	1 1/2 parts Hiram Walker Butterscotch Schnapps 
-	1 part Hiram Walker White Crème de Cacao 
Shake and strain into martini glass, garnish with chocolate drizzle.
