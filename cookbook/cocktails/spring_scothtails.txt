April's Scotchtail is perfect for this time of year (no matter what the
weather's doing) and the flavor combo of grapefruit and honey is divine!
Easy-to-make, too! What more could you ask for?

April Cocktail

1 1/2 Chivas Regal 12 yo
1 1/2 oz. Ruby Grapefruit Juice
2 barspoons honey
Dash Grapefruit bitters

Stir the honey in the empty old fashioned glass. Add the whisky and
continue until dissolved. Following the addition of the Grapefruit
Juice, top with crushed ice.

If grapefruit isn't your style, try this light and refreshing drink that
would be fantastic through summer!

Cascade

1 1/2 oz Chivas Regal 12 yo
3/4 oz. Monin Mandarin Syrup
3/4 oz. Fresh Lime Juice
Dash Peach Juice
Tonic water.

Shake all ingredients (except tonic) together in a Boston shaker. Pour
over ice and top with tonic water. Garnish with sliced apple.

Cheers!
