Here's an awesome springtime cocktail from Ruby & Sequoia's Tomas Lenko.
Pretty easy too-if you can get your hands on some Sloe Gin. Cheers!

Blue Velvet 

1 1/2 oz. Beefeater 24 gin
Fresh blueberries
1/3 oz. honey
1/3 oz. freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/3 oz. simple syrup
2/3 oz. Sloe Gin

Muddle blueberries in the base of a shaker. Add ingredients and shake
with ice. Strain into an ice-filled glass.
