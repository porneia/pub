If you're anything like me and are starting up your annual Spring
Cleaning project, don't leave out the liquor cabinet. Finish off those
seasonal liqueurs you have with some of these flavorful finds!

Winter Sunshine Martini:
2 parts ABSOLUT Citron Vodka
1 part Hiram Walker Gingerbread Liqueur
1 part Hiram Walker Triple Sec.
Combine ingredients in a shaker with ice. Shake vigorously and strain
into a martini glass. Garnish with a lemon wheel.

Spicy Irish:
1 1/4 parts Jameson Irish Whiskey
1 part Hiram Walker Gingerbread Liqueur
Splash Ginger Ale.
Fill in a tall glass with ice. Pour ingredients as listed. Garnish with
both a lemon and an orange wedge.

Smashing Pumpkin Martini:
3/4 part Beefeater Gin
1 1/4 parts Hiram Walker Pumpkin Spice
3/4 part fresh sour mix (1 part each lemon & lime juices, 2 parts simple
syrup)
Combine ingredients in shaker with ice. Shake vigorously. Strain into 
cinnamon-sugar rimmed martini glass. Garnish and serve.
