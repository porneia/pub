by Rogue Creamery on Wednesday, 15 February 2012 at 11:56 ·

Classic comfort food with a Southern Oregon twist.  Our Chocolate
Stout Cheddar stars in this satisfying traditional with a savory layer
of meat and root vegetables topped with a layer of cheesy mashed
potatoes. Make ahead in single serving dishes for a satisfying midweek
meal.



6 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered

1 ½ lb. organic ground beef or lamb

1 c. onion, finely chopped

2 c. vegetables: combination of chopped carrots, parsnips, peas

2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce

3/4 c. Rogue Ales Chocolate Stout

½ c. milk or cream

¾ c.. butter

8 oz. Rogue Chocolate Stout Cheddar, shredded

salt and pepper to taste



Boil potatoes in salted water until tender (20-25 minutes).



While potatoes cook,  melt ¼ c. butter in a large, deep skillet.
Saute onions over medium heat, 2-3 minutes.  Add carrots and
parsnips.  Cook for 5 minutes.  Add ground meat and cook until no
longer pink.  Add peas, Chocolate Stout and salt and pepper to taste.
Reduce heat to low and cook for 10 minutes until stout is reduced.



Mash potatoes in a large bowl with remaining butter and milk.  Season
to taste.  Add 1 ½ c. shredded cheese.  Stir to combine.



Pour meat and vegetable mixture into a large casserole or six single
serving dishes.  Top meat mixture with mashed potatoes and remaining
cheese.



Bake in a 400 degree oven until bubbling and browned on top, 25 -30
minutes.
