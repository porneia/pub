Sambousek (Lebanese Meat Pastries) - a Lebanese recipe
These Lebanese appetizers remind me of Bierocks or Pierogis.
You can substitute lamb for the beef.  If you do, try adding a
bit of mint.
Some people like to seal a little cheese with the meat in the
sambousek.  You can even make these with just cheese, much like a
pierogi.
These are best when fresh from the pan.  The wife likes these
with jajeek (similar to Tzatziki).
Serves 8.

3 cups flour
1 cup warm water
1 tsp yeast
pinch salt
1 tsp oil
1 Tbsp olive oil
2 onions
1 tsp minced garlic
1 tsp pepper
Pinch fennel
3/4 tsp cumin
1 Tbsp chopped parsley
1 lb ground beef

Put the flour in a mixing bowl.
Dissolve the yeast in the cup of warm water.
Add the yeast and a pinch of salt to the flour.
Mix the dough with a wooden spoon or your hands.
Add the oil and knead until the dough is elastic.
Divide the dough into about a dozen pieces and set aside.
Allow the dough to rise for an hour.
Finely dice or grate the onion.
Cook the onion with the rest of the ingredients over low heat in
the olive oil, stirring well to thoroughly mix the beef with the
onions and spices.
When the meat is browned, remove from heat and cool.
Roll the pieces of dough out to 1/16 inch thick circles.
Place a spoonful of meat in the center of each piece.
Fold the dough over the meat to form half circles.
Seal the edges together.
Heat enough oil in a frying pan to cover the Sambousek while
cooking.
Deep fry on both sides.
Drain and serve while still hot.
