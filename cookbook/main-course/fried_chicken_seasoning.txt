I do it this way.  I rub in the seasoning prior to dipping and 
flouring.  This is what I use:  (use whatever measuring unit
                                 you wish)

2 salt
1 curry powder
1 very fine chopped garlic; dried out a bit(or garlic powder)
1/2 chili powder
1/2 cumin
1/2 cayenne
1/2 black pepper
1 oregano (dried)
1 basil (dried)
1 parsley (dried)

Mix and rub.  I also rub some under skin.  The same mix is 
used for roast chicken EXCEPT that I add melted butter to
the spice mix as well as lemon or lime juice.  I then paint
the outside of the roast chicken.  I should next time also
put some of this stuff under the skin; also next time, I'll
use olive oil instead of the melted butter.
